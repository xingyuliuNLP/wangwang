data-page="page_1"></span>there were any lingering doubt that Donald Trump’s trade war with China is exerting a considerable cost on the American economy, it was erased on Tuesday, when a closely watched <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.instituteforsupplymanagement.org/ISMReport/MfgROB.cfm?SSO=1" target="_blank">statistic</a> indicated that factory output dropped in August.  The news <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/factory-output-dropped-0-2-in-july-11565875276" target="_blank">confirmed</a> other recent suggestions that the manufacturing sector has entered a <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-08-23/trade-war-manufacturing-recession-pressure-industrial-companies" target="_blank">recession</a>.</p><p>That doesn’t mean the over-all economy is slumping—not yet, anyway. These days, manufacturing is dwarfed by the giant service sector, which includes industries like health care, finance, and retailing. But it’s still a key part of the economy, and it plays an outsized role in Trump country, particularly the Midwest.</p><p>During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to restore manufacturing to its former glory, and during the first two years of his Presidency he boasted frequently about how well it was going.  On Tuesday, he didn’t comment on the new report, which coincided with another drop on Wall Street. Last week, stock prices rose as traders seized upon hopeful statements from U.S. and Chinese officials about restarting the stalled trade talks. Now the reality of the situation has set in.</p><p>This past Sunday, a raft of <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://apnews.com/60f934ba84e444079b84772e4b24bca4" target="_blank">new tariffs</a> on Chinese goods entering the United States went into effect. So did some new duties on American goods entering China, which Beijing imposed as a retaliatory move. Unlike the initial Trump tariffs, which were levied mainly on “intermediate products” made in China, such as parts for computers and autos, the new levies, of fifteen per cent, apply to many consumer goods, including clothes and sports equipment. That means their effects—higher prices—will be more visible to ordinary Americans.</p><div class="" data-type="callout" data-callout="inline-recirc"><div id="RecircCarousel" class="recircCarouselUnit

Rohde</a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><p>As recently as March, Trump <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/02/trump-trade-wars-are-good-and-easy-to-win.html" target="_blank">claimed</a> that “trade wars are good, and easy to win.”  That statement ignored history and the business environment facing American manufacturing companies. Many U.S. businesses, facing a steep price hike for the Chinese-made components they rely on to assemble finished goods,  were forced to try to source from other countries. Meanwhile, the entire manufacturing sector was faced with rising uncertainty about when, or whether, the trade war would be resolved.  With Trump issuing dire threats one moment and making nice with <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/xi-jinping">Xi Jinping</a> the next, it was hard for anyone to figure out how things would play out.</p><p>The net results of all of this were cuts in production and postponements to capital investments. Back in April, just one month after Trump issued his idle boast, the manufacturing index maintained by the Institute for Supply Management, a nonprofit trade group, started to drop. Tuesday’s announcement confirmed that the index, which is based on a survey of purchasing managers at large and small firms, slid again in August. That means it has fallen for five months in a row, and the chain of causation isn’t in dispute. For the respondents to the monthly I.S.M. survey, when it comes to lost manufacturing power, “trade remains the most significant issue,” Timothy Fiore, who compiles the index, <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.npr.org/2019/09/03/757071073/manufacturing-shrinks-for-1st-time-in-3-years-on-trade-tensions" target="_blank">told</a> National Public Radio on Tuesday.</p><p>In spite of Trump’s bluster, he is looking more and more boxed in. All along, his thinking has been that export-dependent China simply couldn’t withstand a lengthy trade war with its largest trading partner. But the government in Beijing has held firm, despite a sharp slowdown in the Chinese economy. Rather than acceding to Trump’s demands for extensive changes in how it organizes its economy and treats American firms, China has responded to each of his escalations with retaliatory measures. On Sunday, the Chinese government filed a complaint over Trump’s latest tariffs with the World Trade Organization, the intergovernmental ruling body that it joined in 2001. In a <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.shine.cn/biz/economy/1909031322/" target="_blank">statement</a>, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said that China would “firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests” and “firmly defend the multilateral trading system and international trade order in accordance with relevant WTO rules.”</p><p>With the Communist Party of China gearing up for a <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-08/29/c_138348938.htm" target="_blank">big celebration</a> at the start of next month, marking the seventieth anniversary of the establishment of the People’s Republic, it seems unlikely that Chinese trade negotiators will make any big concessions during the next few weeks. Will Trump? Unlike Xi and other Chinese leaders, he has an election to worry about. The conflicting signals he sent during August—escalating his tariff threats and then talking up the possibility of a resolution after the Dow dived—demonstrated that he is at least intermittently aware of the political constraints he faces.</p><p>As part of his strategy of escalation, he has threatened to further expand his tariffs on October 1st and December 15th. If these changes went into effect, virtually all imports from China would be facing some sort of a levy, and <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.piie.com/blogs/trade-and-investment-policy-watch/us-china-trade-war-guns-august" target="_blank">the average rate</a> would be 24.3 per cent, according to Chad Bown, of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. China would retaliate again, and, entering an election year, Trump would be in an all-out trade war. It can only be guessed how the stock market would react to this prospect. Despite the prospect of more interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, it may be ugly.</p><p>The alternative could be for Trump to accept some sort of a face-saving deal, in which China agreed to increase its imports of American goods, particularly agricultural goods, and the United States agreed to roll back some of its tariffs and ease the restrictions it has imposed on Huawei, the Chinese technology company. Such a deal would involve the Trump Administration<span data-page="page_final"></span> setting aside, at least for now, its demands for structural changes to China’s model of state-led capitalism. But it might calm the nerves of investors and help prevent the troubles of the manufacturing sector from spreading into the broader economy. (Over-all spending by consumers has held up pretty well so far, but <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-30/u-s-consumer-sentiment-falls-most-since-2012-on-tariff-concern" target="_blank">a report</a>, released on Friday, showed consumer confidence taking a dive in August.)</p><p>On Tuesday, Tariff Man was back in Twitter-attack mode, warning China not to try to wait out his Administration, saying that the terms of a deal in his second term would be “MUCH TOUGHER.” China’s supply chain, Trump <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/trump-warns-china-against-dragging-its-feet-in-trade-talks-idUSKCN1VO1K0" target="_blank">said</a>, would “crumble” in the meantime. Words are cheap. Over the next few weeks, his actions will be the thing to watch.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="ArticleFooter__footer___3-wlJ"><div class="ArticleContributors__bio___3XQjk"><div class="ArticleContributors__contributorWrapper___1CrIJ"><div class="Avatar__avatar___1_uRc ArticleContributors__bioAvatar___11Nu0"><a class="Link__link___3dWao  " href="/contributors/john-cassidy"><div class="Image__image___1PhYl" role="button" tabindex="0"><picture class="component-responsive-image"><source srcSet="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b6d8b51cf59fc423c4d/1:1/w_130,c_limit/cassidy-john-2.png, https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b6d8b51cf59fc423c4d/1:1/w_260,c_limit/cassidy-john-2.png 2x"/><img alt="" src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097b6d8b51cf59fc423c4d/1:1/w_130,c_limit/cassidy-john-2.png" title=""/></picture></div></a></div><ul class="ArticleContributors__contributorBios___3_jrJ false"><li><p class="ArticleContributors__contributorBioText___3m1QB">John Cassidy has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 1995.

football game aboard Air Force One on his way back from his Florida home, and he also threatened to attack Iranian cultural sites. Later the same evening, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association gave out its annual [Golden Globe Awards](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-2020-golden-globes-recap-michelle-williams-for-president), snubbing the film that serves as the best illustration of our current political and cultural predicament: “Jojo Rabbit.”\n\nTaika Waititi’s movie is about a ten-year-old boy who is a fervent Nazi until, just before Germany loses the war, he falls in love with a Jewish girl who is hiding in his attic. The film has been [criticized](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/movies/the-producers-jojo-rabbit.html) for making light of unspeakable crimes. My colleague Richard Brody [objected](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/springtime-for-nazis-how-the-satire-of-jojo-rabbit-backfires) not so much to the film’s gags as to the empathy it shows to the haters, and, indeed, the movie can be read as a beautifully rendered version of a certain journalistic genre: the condescending [portrayal](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/i-traveled-to-a-diner-in-trump-country-to-write-another-article-on-whether-the-presidents-supporters-still-want-to-quote-smash-my-libtard-face-in) of the misguided and misinformed Trump supporter. But it can also be read as an account of the profound and willful idiocy that underlies political tragedy. Seen this way—and this is the way I’ve seen it both times I’ve watched “Jojo Rabbit”—the movie is as brave and insightful a portrait of autocracy as any contemporary work of art has offered.\n\nThe protagonist, Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis), has an imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler. Early in the movie, the Hitler of Jojo’s imagination (played by Waititi) implores Jojo to disregard the opinions of others: “People used to say a lot of nasty things about me. ‘This guy is a lunatic!’ ‘Look at that psycho, he’s going to get us all killed!’&nbsp;” Those people are right, of course, but, at the moment when imaginary Hitler is speaking to Jojo, the real Hitler’s power is so immense that those true statements sound absurd to Jojo and millions of other Germans. They believe in Hitler and what he tells them.\n\nThe movie’s most colorful propagandist is Fraulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson), who is the source of much of Jojo’s knowledge about Jews. Once upon a time, she tells a group of Hitler Youth, a Jew mated with a fish, and, since then, the Jews have been covered in scales. “The Aryans are one thousand times more civilized and advanced than any other race,” she adds, to the boys’ delight. “Now get your things together, kids. It’s time to burn some books!” Later, she provides a lesson in conspiracy thinking, when she tells the story of her uncle: “A Jew hypnotized him, and he became a massive drunk and a gambler, and he cheated on his wife, and he had an inappropriate relationship with my sister. And then he drowned, in an unrelated accident, but it was Jew’s fault.” \n\nUp to about the middle of the movie, the jokes are palatable and the parallels to the present day are clear. There is the scene in which Jojo and his mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), play out a version of many Americans’ holiday-dinner experiences. Rosie is happy that the Allies are advancing. “Goddammit, why does that make you happy?” Jojo asks. “You hate your country that much?” Rosie explains, “I love my country. It’s the war I hate. It’s pointless and stupid, and the sooner we have peace, the better.” Jojo is outraged. “We will crush our enemies into dust! And, when they are destroyed, we shall use their brains as toilets!” he says, slamming his little hands on the white tablecloth with green trim. Rosie moves to end the debate. “O.K., no more politics,” she says. “Dinner is neutral ground. Table is Switzerland. Let’s eat.” Imaginary Hitler is at the table with them, but only Jojo can see him. \n\nBut then the jokes get harder to swallow. The Gestapo shows up at the house. We don’t know what they are looking for, but we know that there is a lot to hide in Jojo’s house: Rosie is in the resistance, and Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie), the Jewish girl, lives in the attic. The gag here is in the heil-Hitlering: every new person who enters the scene greets every other individually, with a “Heil Hitler,” until we get to ten call-and-response “Heil Hitler”s. There are several heil-Hitlering sequences—the scene drags on and on, and the dread builds. The Gestapo men, dressed in black overcoats and hats, are ridiculous and terrifying at once. \n\nSpoiler alert: resistance proves to be not only deathly dangerous but also ineffectual. As far as we know, all that Rosie has been caught doing is distributing tiny ribbon-like flyers with the words “Free Germany” on them. For this, she is hanged in the town square, where Jojo happens upon her body. His grief looks ridiculous (he tries, and fails, to tie his hanged mother’s shoe) and his rage is misdirected (he tries, and fails, to kill Elsa by stabbing her). This is another devastating lesson: the great hollowing-out force of totalitarianism renders even tragedy absurd.\n\nThe only actual feat of heroism in the movie—the only act that involves sacrifice and has consequences—is committed by Captain Klenzendorf (Sam Rockwell), a gay Nazi who, decked out in his end-of-days uniform adorned with red fringe, spits at Jojo and calls him a “dirty Jew” in order to save him from being executed by Russian soldiers, who, in short order, open machine fire on Klenzendorf and others. Justice that follows totalitarianism is no justice at all.\n\nWhat “Jojo Rabbit” has to say about power, history, and humanity is terrifying. We, Americans and humans, generally prefer other portrayals. On Sunday, the HBO series “[Chernobyl](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/06/24/how-when-they-see-us-and-chernobyl-make-us-look)” won a Golden Globe for best limited series. [The series](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/what-hbos-chernobyl-got-right-and-what-it-got-terribly-wrong) offers a version of the 1986 nuclear accident in which evil people who know exactly what they are doing exposed millions of people to radiation poisoning and then covered it up. In the series, they are opposed by people who are heroic, pure, and capable of great accomplishments, such as conducting a thorough investigation, even under totalitarianism. In its way, this is a comforting story, clearly preferable to having to consider that tens of millions of people died during the Second World War because of a maniac whom no one took seriously until he was suddenly in power, and whose insane ideas had incredible traction.\n\nThe ideas of history and politics contained in “Jojo Rabbit” are as accurate as they are terrifying. We don’t want to imagine that absurd incompetents can cause enormous human tragedy, and we don’t want to think that tragedy, whether it’s enormous or not, can appear absurd. Either possibility has dire implications for our own moment. When the President of the United States is [tweeting an imaginary “legal notice”](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1213919480574812160) of intent to bomb other countries, and when he announces and repeats [his intention to target cultural sites](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1213593975732527112), which is a war crime, and when he sincerely believes that this is the best way to be President, we would prefer to think that, in global history and politics, the absurd cannot be tragic and the tragic cannot be absurd. But the truth of the matter is that we are careening into our darkest moment yet, and we look ridiculous doing it. There is a movie about that.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d051f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d051f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Movies","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"movies"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Movies","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"movies"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald

(Its English title, depending on the translation, is “[Voices from Chernobyl](https://www.amazon.com/Voices-Chernobyl-History-Nuclear-Disaster/dp/0312425848)” or “Chernobyl Prayer.”) The reason, she said, was that none of her interlocutors—people who lived in the area affected by the disaster—knew how they were supposed to talk about it. For her other books, Alexievich interviewed people about their experience of the Second World War, the Soviet war in Afghanistan, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. For all of these other events and periods in Russian history, there were widely adopted narratives, habits of speaking that, Alexievich found, had a way of overshadowing actual personal experience and private memory. But when she asked survivors about Chernobyl they accessed their own stories more easily, because the story hadn’t been told. The Soviet media disseminated very little information about the disaster. There were no books or movies or songs. There was a vacuum.\n\nAlexievich’s book about Chernobyl was published in Russian in 1997, more than ten years after one of the reactors at the Chernobyl power plant exploded, in what was probably the worst nuclear accident in history. One of the most remarkable facts about Chernobyl is that the narrative vacuum had persisted for that long, and, in fact, it has persisted since: Alexievich’s book came to prominence, both in Russia and in the West, only following her Nobel Prize win. There have been stories in the media in Russia and abroad, many of them on the odd tourist industry that has sprung up in the disaster zone; there has been a BBC documentary and a bizarre American-Ukrainian [documentary](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4082596/). But in the past year two books, [one by a historian](https://www.amazon.com/Chernobyl-History-Catastrophe-Serhii-Plokhy/dp/1541617096) and [the other by a journalist](https://www.amazon.com/Midnight-Chernobyl-Greatest-Nuclear-Disaster-ebook/dp/B07GNV7PNH), have attempted to tell the definitive documentary story of the disaster. Finally, the HBO series “Chernobyl,” the fifth and final episode of which aired Monday, tells a fictionalized version. It being television, and [very well-received television at that](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/06/04/chernobyl-ends-its-hbo-run-as-the-highest-audience-rated-tv-series-in-history/#73d1445f6413), it is the series, rather than the books, that will probably finally fill the vacuum where the story of Chernobyl should be. This is not a good thing.\n\nBefore I get to what the series got so terribly wrong, I should acknowledge what it got right. In “Chernobyl,” which was created and written by Craig Mazin and directed by Johan Renck, the material culture of the Soviet Union is reproduced with an accuracy that has never before been seen in Western television or film—or, for that matter, in Russian television or film. Clothes, objects, and light itself seem to come straight out of nineteen-eighties Ukraine, Belarus, and Moscow. (There are tiny errors, like a holiday uniform worn by schoolchildren on a non-holiday, or teen-agers carrying little kids’ school bags, but this is truly splitting hairs.) Soviet-born Americans—and, indeed, Soviet-born Russians—have been tweeting and blogging in awe at the uncanny precision with which the physical surroundings of Soviet people have been reproduced. The one noticeable mistake in this respect concerns the series makers’ apparent ignorance of the vast divisions between different socioeconomic classes in the Soviet Union: in the series, Valery Legasov (Jared Harris), a member of the Academy of Sciences, lives in nearly the same kind of squalor as a fireman in the Ukrainian town of Pripyat. In fact, Legasov would have lived in an entirely different kind of squalor than the fireman did.\n\nHerein lies one of the series’ biggest flaws: its failure to accurately portray Soviet relationships of power. There are exceptions, flashes of brilliance that shed light on the bizarre workings of Soviet hierarchies. In the first episode, for example, during an emergency meeting of the Pripyat ispolkom, the town’s governing council, an elder statesman, Zharkov (Donald Sumpter), delivers a chilling, and chillingly accurate, speech, urging his compatriots to “have faith.” “We seal off the city,” Zharkov says. “No one leaves. And cut the phone lines. Contain the spread of misinformation. That is how we keep the people from undermining the fruits of their own labor.” This statement has everything: the bureaucratic indirectness of Soviet speech, the privileging of “fruits of labor” over the people who created them, and, of course, the utter disregard for human life.\n\nThe final episode of “Chernobyl” also contains a scene that encapsulates the Soviet system perfectly. During the trial of three men who have been deemed responsible for the disaster, a member of the Central Committee overrules the judge, who then looks to the prosecutor for direction—and the prosecutor gives that direction with a nod. This is exactly how Soviet courts worked: they did the bidding of the Central Committee, and the prosecutor wielded more power than the judge.\n\nUnfortunately, apart from these striking moments, the series often veers between caricature and folly. In Episode 2, for example, the Central Committee member Boris Shcherbina (Stellan Skarsgård) threatens to have Legasov shot if he doesn’t tell him how a nuclear reactor works. There are a lot of people throughout the series who appear to act out of fear of being shot. This is inaccurate: summary executions, or even delayed executions on orders of a single apparatchik, were not a feature of Soviet life after the nineteen-thirties. By and large, Soviet people did what they were told without being threatened with guns or any punishment.\n\nSimilarly repetitive and ridiculous are the many scenes of heroic scientists confronting intransigent bureaucrats by explicitly criticizing the Soviet system of decision-making. In Episode 3, for example, Legasov asks, rhetorically, “Forgive me—maybe I’ve just spent too much time in my lab, or maybe I’m just stupid. Is this really the way it all works? An uninformed, arbitrary decision that will cost who knows how many lives that is made by some apparatchik, some career Party man?” Yes, of course this is the way it works, and, no, he hasn’t been in his lab so long that he didn’t realize that this is how it works. The fact of the matter is, if he didn’t know how it worked, he would never have had a lab. \n\nResignation was the defining condition of Soviet life. But resignation is a depressing and untelegenic spectacle. So the creators of “Chernobyl” imagine confrontation where confrontation was unthinkable—and, in doing so, they cross the line from conjuring a fiction to creating a lie. The Belarusian scientist Ulyana Khomyuk (Emily Watson) is even more confrontational than Legasov. “I am a nuclear physicist,” she tells an apparatchik, in Episode 2\\. “Before you were Deputy Secretary, you worked in a shoe factory.” First, she’d never say this. Second, the apparatchik might have worked at a shoe factory, but, if he was an apparatchik, he was no cobbler; he has come up the Party ladder, which might indeed have begun at the factory—but in an office, not on the factory floor. The apparatchik—or, more accurately, the caricature of the apparatchik—pours himself a glass of vodka from a carafe that sits on his desk and responds, “Yes, I worked in a shoe factory. And now I’m in charge.” He toasts, in what appears to be the middle of the day: “To the workers of the world.” No. No carafe, no vodka in the workplace in front of a hostile stranger, and no boasting “I’m in charge.”\n\nThe biggest fiction in this scene, though, is Khomyuk herself. Unlike other characters, she is made up—according to the closing titles, she represents dozens of scientists who helped Legasov investigate the cause of the disaster. Khomyuk appears to embody every possible Hollywood fantasy. She is a truth-knower: the first time we see her, she is already figuring out that something has gone terribly wrong, and she is grasping it terribly fast, unlike the dense men at the actual scene of the disaster, who seem to need hours to take it in. She is also a truth-seeker: she interviews dozens of people (some of them as they are dying of radiation exposure), digs up a scientific paper that has been censored, and figures out exactly what happened, minute by minute. She also gets herself arrested and then immediately seated at a meeting on the disaster, led by Gorbachev. None of this is possible, and all of it is hackneyed. The problem is not just that Khomyuk is a fiction; it’s that the kind of expert knowledge she represents is a fiction. The Soviet system of propaganda and censorship existed not so much for the purpose of spreading a particular message as for the purpose of making learning impossible, replacing facts with mush, and handing the faceless state a monopoly on defining an ever-shifting reality.\n\nIn the absence of a Chernobyl narrative, the makers of the series have used the outlines of a disaster movie. There are a few terrible men who bring the disaster about, and a few brave and all-knowing ones, who ultimately save Europe from becoming uninhabitable and who tell the world the truth. It is true that Europe survived; it is not true that anyone got to the truth, or told it.\n\nThe Harvard historian Serhii Plokhy’s 2018 book on Chernobyl reconstructs the sequence of events and assigns blame. In effect, Plokhy argues, it was the Soviet system that created Chernobyl and made the explosion inevitable. Glimmers of this understanding appear in the HBO series, too. In the final episode, Legasov, testifying as a witness, tells a Soviet court that the disaster happened because the tips of the control rods were made of graphite, which sped up the reaction, when the control rod was supposed to slow it down. When asked, by the prosecutor, why the reactor was designed this way, Legasov cites the same reason that other safety precautions are ignored and other corners are cut: “It’s cheaper.” He seems to be damning the whole system.\n\nMore often, however, we are given to believe that the three men who were put on trial—and especially one of them, a particularly unattractive villain by the name of Anatoly Dyatlov (Paul Ritter)—are to blame. We see him strong-arming younger, better men into actions that will ultimately lead to catastrophe. All because, it seems, he wants a promotion. In fact, it wasn’t the carrot of a single promotion, or even several promotions, and it wasn’t one nasty and abusive boss. It was the system, made up primarily of pliant men and women, that cut its own corners, ignored its own precautions, and ultimately blew up its own nuclear reactor for no good reason except that this was how things were done. The viewer is invited to fantasize that, if not for Dyatlov, the better men would have done the right thing and the fatal flaw in the reactor, and the system itself, might have remained latent. This is a lie.\n\nIt would be harder to show a system digging its own grave instead of an ambitious, evil man causing the disaster. In the same way, it’s harder to see dozens of scientists looking for clues when you can just create a single fantasy character who will have all the good disaster-fighting traits. This is the great-men (and one woman) narrative of history, where it’s a few steps, a few decisions, made by a few men that matter, rather than the mess that humans make and from which they suffer.\n\nIt was the stories of those who suffered that most interested Alexievich. The series actually makes use of one of the stories in her book: the story of Lyudmilla Ignatenko (Jessie Buckley), who broke the rules by staying with her firefighter husband in the hospital until he died, even though she was pregnant. (She lied about it.) Her baby lived for four hours after birth; she had apparently absorbed the radiation, saving her mother’s life. Ignatenko’s monologue in Alexievich’s book is some of the most memorable reading I have ever done. (I once asked Alexievich if people actually talk like that; she agreed that the quality of Ignatenko’s speech was “Shakespearean.”) In the series, though, Ignatenko’s story is partly shown and partly told by Khomyuk. In the great-men version of history, only the powerful have speaking parts. Even the house pets left in the “exclusion zone” after people are evacuated are shown through the eyes of men who are sent there to execute them. We never see these pets through the eyes of their owners. We hardly see any of the evacuees at all, and we are given only one indication that some people [resisted and refused](https://www.wired.com/1996/03/day-after/?mbid=social_fb_onsiteshare&fbclid=IwAR0sScyIgwDMm8gJm9-2aarlJkh0Zn0Nt0Zs7eSWtGTnCkrEmXZpD5EWkro) to leave: an old woman who, at the beginning of Episode 4, obstinately continues milking her cow after she is repeatedly ordered to move.\n\nTestifying in court during the final episode, Legasov says, “Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. Sooner or later, that debt is paid. That is how an RBMK reactor core explodes. Lies.” One would think that a vacuum created by lies could be filled by truth. Instead, it is filled by an entirely fictional, fantastical trial at which a large group of people—scientists, we are told—are given an accurate assessment of events in an accessible, brilliant speech, the likes of which Soviet courts didn’t feature.\n\nLegasov gets the last word. He speaks of “the gift of Chernobyl: where I once would fear the cost of truth, I only ask”—the screen fades to black—“what is the cost of lies?” One might say that the cost of lies is more lies. One might say that these are fantasies, embellishments, shortcuts, and even translations. Whatever they are, they are not the truth.\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d314a08312cd3aa6ce3","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Chernobyl","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"chernobyl"},{"id":"5c2e1c777e716b454591ad9f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Russia","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"russia"},{"id":"5c2e1c8d81ab3335f580f196","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Soviet Union","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"soviet-union"},{"id":"5c2e1c7b41c92e2c9b85da1a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Television","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"television"},{"id":"5c2e1c7b4a08312cd3aa6c3e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"HBO","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hbo"},{"id":"5c2e1f6eaef5062c9d94ab93","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Oral History","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"oral-history"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"},{"id":"590411aa6870945b4d262380","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a6e62e2e17730741c6b7","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Masha Gessen began contributing to *The New Yorker* in 2014 and became a staff writer in 2017\\.

No sooner had Gervais exited than the Egyptian-American comedian [Ramy Youssef](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/22/ramy-youssefs-sort-of-sacred-standup), who won for his self-titled Hulu series, said, “I would like to thank my God. *Allahu akbar*.” Moments later, Russell Crowe won for his role in “[The Loudest Voice](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/the-loudest-voice-eviscerates-roger-ailes-and-fox-news).” Crowe was back in Australia, protecting his family from brush fires, and it fell to Jennifer Aniston to read his urgent message that “the tragedy unfolding in Australia is climate-change-based.” Suddenly, giving a damn was in.\n\nBrad Pitt, who won for “[Once Upon a Time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in Hollywood](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/08/05/quentin-tarantino-tweaks-history-in-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood),” summed up the anti-Gervais tone when he ended his speech: “Hey, if you see a chance to be kind to someone tomorrow, take it. I think we need it.” Earnestness, especially the political kind, is tricky business at awards shows, but the dark early days of the New Year were impossible to keep at bay. It’s been two years since the Golden Globes were the site of a [red-carpet siege](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-2018-golden-globes-oprah-leads-a-decisive-feminist-takeover), as celebrities in black dresses and Time’s Up pins spoke out against the mistreatment of women in Hollywood. This year’s preshow was free of insurrection, other than Billy Porter’s merciless domination of the red carpet, this time in white satin and feathers. Inside the hall, however, passions prevailed. Kate McKinnon, in her tribute to Ellen DeGeneres, who received a lifetime-achievement award, spoke of the validating effect that DeGeneres’s coming out had on her in 1997\\. [Sam Mendes](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/09/24/sam-mendes-directorial-discoveries), who received the best-director prize, for “1917,” which was also the surprise winner for best drama (the full list of winners is [here](https://www.goldenglobes.com/winners-nominees/2020/all)), dedicated the award to his grandfather, who enlisted in the First World War at seventeen, adding, “I fervently hope it never, ever happens again.” Patricia Arquette, who won for the miniseries “The Act,” burst whatever Hollywood bubble might have protected the room, sounding off on the threat of war, the courage of migrants, the calamity in Australia, and the importance of voting in 2020\\. Even Quentin Tarantino, picking up the screenplay award, for “Once Upon a Time&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in Hollywood,” had a cause, of sorts: he dedicated his win to the screenwriter Robert Bolt, who was responsible for “Lawrence of Arabia” and “Doctor Zhivago.” \n\nWhat does Tom Hanks care about? Punctuality, it turns out. Accepting the lifetime-achievement award for film, the Nicest Man in Hollywood was indeed nice, but also hopped up on cold medicine that made him “a little jittery,” he warned. His emotions did seem all over the place. Moments after singing the theme from “The Love Boat,” he choked up. Later, he teared up again, right after treating us to his Cecil B. DeMille impression. This guy is one dose of Mucinex away from his third Oscar! In between, he noted, with the gentle authority of Mister Rogers, that showing up on time is one of an actor’s “greatest liberating acts.” As my colleague Rachel Syme [noted](https://twitter.com/rachsyme/status/1214019925746032640), this may have been payback. Hours earlier, his wife, Rita Wilson, had taken to [social media](https://twitter.com/RitaWilson/status/1213940059868545024) to vent about a hair-and-makeup artist who was unforgivably late.\n\nThere was no more eloquent plea than that of Michelle Williams, who won for her portrayal of Gwen Verdon in “[Fosse/Verdon](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/15/what-does-it-take-to-be-a-female-genius)” and, with the help of its co-creator, Thomas Kail, is currently pregnant. Williams thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, as many did, but then pivoted: the H.F.P.A., she said, had acknowledged not only her performance but the sum of her choices. “I’ve tried my very best to live a life of my own making,” she continued, “not just a series of events that happened to me but one that I can stand back and look at and recognize my handwriting all over, sometimes messy and scrawling, sometimes careful and precise, but one that I had carved with my own hand. And I wouldn’t have been able to do this without employing a woman’s right to choose.” The progression—from artistry to agency to electoral urgency—was as beautifully angled as a Bob Fosse pose. Our political candidates could take notes on fusing the personal and the political.\n\nNot that cheekiness didn’t have its place. There were some memorable wisecracks—notably from Gervais’s fellow-Brits. Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who accepted two awards for “Fleabag,” thanked Barack Obama for putting the show on his year-end [list](https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1211331851358494720), adding, saucily, “As some of you may know, he’s always been on mine.” (In the pilot, Fleabag has an erotic encounter with a video of Obama giving a Presidential address.) Olivia Colman, who won for playing Queen Elizabeth II on “The Crown,” was her usual combination of delighted and oh-so baffled. “I’ve already got a little bit boozy, because I thought this wasn’t going to happen,” she confessed. Sacha Baron Cohen, introducing a clip from “[Jojo Rabbit](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/springtime-for-nazis-how-the-satire-of-jojo-rabbit-backfires),” joked, “The hero of this next movie is a naïve, misguided child who spreads Nazi propaganda and only has imaginary friends. His name is Mark Zuckerberg.” \n\nWe weren’t free of the preening kind of political speech, either, thanks to Joaquin Phoenix, who won for his performance in “[Joker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/joker-is-a-viewing-experience-of-rare-numbing-emptiness)” and seemed to accept his award in a state of fitfully awaking from a nap. Much of what he said was peppered with expletives, and therefore unheard by the TV audience. But, from what I could gather, his message was that awards shows are phony baloney and that it’s not enough for his peers to send good thoughts to Australia or vote in elections: “We don’t have to take private jets to Palm Springs for the awards sometimes, or back, please.” Fair enough, but it smacked of ethical one-upmanship, and the delivery was hopelessly garbled. Yet, if this were the Iowa caucuses, he’d somehow be beating Michelle Williams.\n\nAs for the award tally, and what it portends for the Oscars next month, it’s worth remembering how eccentric a voting body the H.F.P.A. is. “1917” for the big prize? Nothing for “[The Irishman](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/11/04/remembrance-of-kills-past-in-the-irishman)” or “[Little Women](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/the-compromises-of-greta-gerwigs-little-women)”? You crazy kids! What puzzles me is what these folks consider funny. The category for best comedy or musical film covered the Manson murders and Hitler, while “[Succession](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/the-trash-talk-pyrotechnics-of-the-succession-finale),” the sharpest satire on television, won for best TV drama. And what good is a “musical” category if you’re going to give Renée Zellweger the drama prize for playing Judy Garland? The Golden Globes are Hollywood’s drunk wedding (with Olivia Colman as the tipsy mother of the groom), but this year’s participants seemed to crave some emotional tether to guide them through a glitzy evening in an incongruously menacing world. By the end of the night, even Gervais seemed discombobulated. “Please donate to Australia,” he said, like someone less devilish than he insists he is. Then, remembering himself, he told the departing crowd, “Get drunk. Take your drugs.” The rest was bleeped.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e89ee7fe02cbd16350c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Golden Globes","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"golden-globes"},{"id":"5c2e1f3e01de442c9e3e606b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Michelle Williams","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"michelle-williams"},{"id":"5c2e1c7822d4972cd5b8328d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Hollywood","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hollywood"},{"id":"5c2e1e2bee7fe02cbd1634e4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Time’s Up","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"times-up"},{"id":"5c2e20bce56e652c902749d2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Bong Joon-ho","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"bong-joon-ho"},{"id":"5c2e1d3d36cecf40192142ae","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tom Hanks","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tom-hanks"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907ef01ebe912338a371720","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture-desk"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a03a68b51cf59fc4246f4","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Michael Schulman, a staff writer, has contributed to *The New Yorker* since 2006.

Whereas they turned their production of “Springtime for Hitler,” intended as pro-Nazi propaganda, into the world’s unfunniest comedy in pursuit of colossal failure, “Jojo Rabbit,” meant as an anti-Nazi spectacle, is the world’s unfunniest comedy made in pursuit of success. Even though the target of satire in “Jojo Rabbit” is clearly the Nazis, the movie sharply but unintentionally satirizes itself, as well as its makers and the movie industry at large that saw fit to produce, release, and acclaim it. Although made by the celebrated writer and director Taika Waititi and released by a major studio, “Jojo Rabbit,” with its combination of extreme goofball humor (including a campily over-the-top caricature of Hitler, played by Waititi himself) and grim and earnest portrayal of the terrors of Germany’s genocidal tyranny, plays more like a comedic fantasy composed for *The Onion* as a reductio ad absurdum of the blinkered follies to which Hollywood and its potentates are susceptible.\n\nThe film is set in the last year of the Second World War, in a town in Germany where a ten-year-old boy, Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis), an enthusiastic new member of the Hitler Youth, lives with his mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson). Jojo’s father isn’t home—Rosie says that he’s away at war, but other adults tell Jojo that his father is a coward—and it’s revealed that he is suspected of being a deserter. Rosie, for her part, is quietly but determinedly hostile to the Nazi regime. Yet Jojo has decorated his room with a profusion of Nazi posters and memorabilia, and he’s often visited by his imaginary friend, Adolf Hitler (Waititi), who turns up in the boy’s moments of emotional need, bucking up his courage or assuaging his humiliations. (In his first appearance in the film, Hitler urges Jojo to “Heil” him more confidently.) \n\nJojo’s Hitler Youth brigade, uniformed and organized in the lighthearted tone of a scout troop from “[Moonrise Kingdom](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/loving-moonrise-kingdom-for-the-right-reasons),” is led by a trio of adults, Captain Klenzendorf  (Sam Rockwell), Fred Finkel (Alfie Allen), and Fräulein Rahm (Rebel Wilson), who express virulent, over-the-top mockeries and hatreds of Jews and lead the boys in a monstrous ritual of cruelty. In teaching them to kill for the Führer, they order one of the boys—Jojo—to take hold of a rabbit and snap its neck. Jojo can’t do it, and runs away to the taunts of one leader, who says that if he can’t kill a rabbit maybe he himself is a scared rabbit. The boys start in with a mocking singsong chant of “Jojo Rabbit,” which is where the movie’s title comes from—but while Jojo is running the imaginary Hitler appears beside him, to remind him that it’s good to be a rabbit, that rabbits are wise and cunning and live to fight another day. \n\nBut when Jojo is seriously wounded in a mishap with a grenade caused by his clumsy effort (backed by his imaginary friend, Hitler), he’s relegated to noncombat tasks such as putting up posters in town, and he starts spending a lot of time at home alone. Hearing a noise upstairs, he investigates, finds a cut in a wood panel, pries it open with his Hitler Youth knife, and discovers a space where a teen-age girl is hiding—or, rather, unbeknownst to him, is being hidden by Rosie. Jojo is scared when he finds her. He thinks that she’s a ghost; she denies it, and he asks, “What are you?” She answers, “A Jew,” and he responds, “Gesundheit.” This is the best joke in the movie.\n\nThe girl, Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie), was a friend of Jojo’s late sister, Inge. Despite Jojo’s inculcated hatred for Jews, the lonely and curious boy spends time with Elsa in the upstairs aerie, gleans bits and pieces of her life story, and, despite the difference in their ages (he’s ten, she’s around sixteen), he develops a crush on her (and displays it by writing letters in which he impersonates her former boyfriend, a Jewish resistance fighter named Nathan). Resistance is everywhere: Rosie is revealed, early on, to be more than just privately averse to Nazis: she’s an active, albeit (as far as the movie shows) nonviolent resister. When she and Jojo pass a gibbet in the town square where five ostensible traitors have been hanged, Jojo asks her what they did, and she answers, “What they could.” As proof of their so-called crime, the authorities have pinned small anti-Nazi handbills to their clothing; it turns out that Rosie is the source of those flyers. \n\nMeanwhile, Hitler continues to make his fantasy visitations to Jojo, whose friendship with Elsa deepens along with his anti-Semitic fanaticism. After hearing the Hitler Youth leaders joke about the difficulty of recognizing Jews, he questions Elsa about Jewish traits so that he can compile a hand-drawn instructional manual (filled with absurd caricatures and wild imaginings) on the subject. He asks about “her kind”; she answers, “We’re like you, but human.” When he asks about her horns, she says that hers haven’t grown in yet. Elsa then boasts about being one of God’s chosen people, while Jojo and other Nazis “were chosen by a weak little man who can’t even grow a full mustache.” Yet, for all these exaggerated antics regarding hatred, the movie delivers its earnest terrors in a scene involving a visit from the Gestapo, whose members, while bearing deadly threats, also get a dash of caricature, as one of them (played by Stephen Merchant), seeing the Nazi décor of Jojo’s room, says, “I wish more of our young boys had your blind fanaticism.” \n\nAlthough “Jojo Rabbit” is set during the Second World War, the target of the movie’s derision is self-evident: it goes beyond the particulars of its drama to mock people who hate on the basis of ethnicity, to expose the power of propaganda and adult manipulators to inculcate such hatred in children, and to suggest an eventual cure for such hatred—namely, personal relationships that prove the humanity of the persecuted minority. Put aside the historical matter of how German Jews were deeply integrated into German society, and the likelihood that many Germans, many Nazis, knew their Jewish neighbors well. (This tragic element of history was addressed by the New York-based filmmaker Manfred Kirchheimer, who arrived in the United States in 1936 as a German-Jewish refugee, in his 1986 documentary “[We Were So Beloved](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/13/how-america-receives-refugees)”—the title itself refers to German gentiles’ personal affection for their Jewish neighbors.) In “Jojo Rabbit,” the Nazis, as the iconic extreme of genocidal hatred, stand in for current-day haters.\n\nYet Nazis are easy targets; Hitler and his cronies need little satirizing. (They needed it in their era, and got it, not least, in Hollywood, from the German-Jewish director Ernst Lubitsch, in the film “[To Be or Not to Be](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/dvd-of-the-week-to-be-or-not-to-be).”) Today, making fun of Hitler and his minions is both easy and pointless, because he poses no threat; Waititi is kicking a dead bull. The haters who need satirizing are in power, starting at the top, with members of the Administration and high-ranking advisers, and including participants in the deadly Charlottesville rally. But to make a feature film that openly mocks the President, his aides, and some of his supporters would be taking a risk that’s unlikely from a mainstream filmmaker and studio—at least, until that leader leaves office (see “[Vice](https://www.newyorker.com/goings-on-about-town/movies/vice),” which isn’t even much of a satire).\n\nRather, “Jojo Rabbit” puts forward, with its blend of antics and sentimentality, something like a vision of daily life in Nazi Germany that makes conspicuous not only its terrors and oppressions but also a vision of widespread resistance. It shows, even in comedic form, the regime’s efforts to force citizens into open conformity and practical complicity with its genocidal ideology and practice. But the movie is centered on, so to speak, the good Germans—those, such as Rosie and other so-called traitors, who were active resisters, and also the blatant acts of resistance by individual Nazis who hold public office but nonetheless display risky and self-sacrificing bravery, more than once, in decisive actions that provide the movie with its crucial plot points. “Jojo Rabbit” is conspicuously a movie about the presence of good Nazis who, at critical moments, conducted their own forms of resistance from inside the institutions of power. \n\nIn this way, “Jojo Rabbit,” although set in the past, puts forward a political idea in the present tense. The film is being marketed as \"an anti-hate satire,\" not as “an anti-Nazi satire,” and for once, advertising is truthful. The movie is not substantially about Nazi Germany but uses it as an allegory for current-day expressions and politics of hatred. In showing Jojo’s family story—which includes his mildness and clumsiness, the absence of his father, and that absent father’s past brutality (which is presented solely as heavy yelling, not physical abuse, because the movie has no room for any complicated emotional conflict), Waititi displays a sort of wan humanism in which Jojo’s fanatical Nazism seems excusable, or at least understandable, because it responds to his own personal psychological issues. No less than “[Joker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/joker-is-a-viewing-experience-of-rare-numbing-emptiness),” “Jojo Rabbit” is another contrivance on the theme of “hurt people hurt people.”\n\nAbove all, the subject of “Jojo Rabbit” is, in effect, “Don’t judge a Nazi by its cover”— don’t judge Nazis by their uniforms or their allegiances or their declarations or even their actions. First, acknowledge the extreme danger of offering any resistance to such a tyrannical regime, and have sympathy for ordinary people who are just trying to get by with their heads down and who instead get drawn into the bureaucracy of evil, where, despite their true feelings, they have to feign commitment while doing their jobs or following orders. Second, try to understand the pain that drove them to support or identify with the rule of a bloodthirsty dictator, that motivates them to espouse and advance a deadly hatred of another ethnic group, or that caused a naïve and damaged person to imagine Hitler as a good guy. Third, have confidence—or, rather, to borrow the Hollywood catchword that [Steven Soderbergh has definitively satirized](http://blog.sffs.org/home/2013/4/steven-soderbergh-the-state-of-cinema-video-transcripthtml), “hope”—that, when push comes to shove, a Nazi’s essential decency and humanity will come to the fore and save the day. \n\nThe present-day didacticism of “Jojo Rabbit,” by encouraging viewers to look with benign empathy at Nazis, the cinema’s iconic worst of the worst, is also encouraging a similar sympathy for the Trump supporter next door, and even for the self-caricaturing Trump himself. The actual target of “Jojo Rabbit” isn’t really the haters, it’s those who would presume to hate the haters. The movie doesn’t so much satirize Nazis, let alone expose the fraudulence of contemporary hatemongers (such as neo-Nazis or alt-rightists) or mainstream Republican Trump-cultists. Rather, the movie ultimately cautions against the easy contempt and dismissal of them by liberals and progressives: there are a lot of very fine people on both sides.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b397f5b30646d05ed","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Germany","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"germany"},{"id":"5c2e1d5036cecf40192142c9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Nazism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"nazism"},{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d051f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Movies","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"movies"},{"id":"5c2e1ce322d4972cd5b8330c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Second World War","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"second-world-war"}],"sections":[{"id":"5b2c1d30a721442d1d96d121","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Front Row","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"the-front-row"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e8e68b51cf59fc4246ac","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Richard Brody began writing for *The New Yorker* in 1999 and has contributed articles about the directors [François Truffaut](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/film/such_a_gorgeous_kid_like_me_truffaut), [Jean-Luc Godard](http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2000/11/20/2000_11_20_062_TNY_LIBRY_000022124), and [Wes Anderson](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/11/02/wild-wild-wes).

Iran has not seen such an outpouring of emotion on the streets since the death of the revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in 1989\\. His successor, [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ali-khamenei), wept openly—as did other political leaders and military officers—as he prayed over the casket. Esmail Gha’ani, Suleimani’s successor as head of the Quds Force, the élite wing of the Revolutionary Guards, vowed to confront the United States. “We promise to continue down martyr Soleimani’s path as firmly as before, with the help of God, and, in return for his martyrdom, we aim to get rid of America from the region,” Gha’ani said at the funeral.\n\nSecretary of State [Mike Pompeo](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mike-pompeo) went on five Sunday talk shows—curiously, wearing a [red tie](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pompeo-dismisses-iraqi-leaders-call-for-all-foreign-troops-to-leave/2020/01/05/401dce62-2fc4-11ea-9313-6cba89b1b9fb_story.html) on two shows and a blue tie on three others—to brag about the U.S. operation. “We took a bad guy off the battlefield,” he said, on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “There is less risk today to American forces in the region as a result of that attack.” Yet nothing seems further from the truth. Some form of conflict between the United States and the Islamic Republic, overt or covert, seems more possible now than it has at any time since the 1979 Revolution. The U.S. investment in neighboring Iraq—thousands of American lives, hundreds of billions of dollars in American treasure, decades of American diplomacy—appears to be unravelling, with rippling effects across the Middle East. Diplomatic missions in other Middle Eastern and South Asian countries are on virtual lockdown, with American citizens urged to evacuate Iraq and Iran and lie low elsewhere in the region.\n\nInstead of being a dead bad guy, Suleimani appears almost as potent in his “martyrdom” as he was in life. His death has already spurred anti-American sentiment across the Middle East. It has unified Iran’s divided society. And it has also precipitated the first action to wind down or end the American military presence in the region—Suleimani’s primary mission since he took over the Quds Force, in 1998.\n\nWith almost no debate, the Iraqi Parliament [voted](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/05/world/middleeast/iran-general-soleimani-iraq.html) on Sunday to expel more than five thousand American troops and other foreign forces, jeopardizing a six-year campaign by a U.S.-led coalition against *ISIS*{: .small}. Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi called the U.S. operation against Suleimani a “political assassination” and pressed for “[urgent measures](https://apnews.com/7c94f2ca6c51d9fd822444941893d4be)” to either oust U.S. troops or limit their mission to training Iraqi forces. “Despite the internal and external difficulties that we might face, it remains best for Iraq on principle and practically,” he [said](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-security/huge-crowds-in-iran-for-commanders-funeral-daughter-warns-u-s-of-dark-day-idUSKBN1Z50KU). The vote passed 170–0, largely by Shiite members; even more Sunnis and Kurds didn’t vote at all. The resolution still needs the signature of the Prime Minister, who is Iraq’s Commander-in-Chief, though Mahdi is only in a caretaker role since his resignation, in November. So the Parliament’s move is still subject to the fractured and fragile politics of Iraq.\n\nYet the U.S.-led coalition felt sufficiently threatened that it suspended military operations against *ISIS*{: .small}, also known by its Arabic name, Daesh, which has been resurging in recent months. It still has between fourteen thousand and eighteen thousand jihadi militants in Iraq and Syria, according to U.S. intelligence estimates. U.S. troops have now assumed a defensive posture—just protecting themselves—against possible retaliation by either pro-Iranian militias or by Iran. “This has limited our capacity to conduct training with partners and to support their operations against Daesh and we have therefore paused these activities, subject to continuous review,” the coalition said, in a statement. The hiatus is a boon to *ISIS*{: .small}, which has carried out dozens of bombings and targeted assassinations since the fall of its caliphate, last March. Ironically, the only issue on which Iran and the United States ever coöperated militarily—sometimes operating out of the same Iraqi bases—was fighting the Sunni extremist group. Tensions between the two countries may provide further space for *ISIS*{: .small} to regroup.\n\nIn Iran, Suleimani’s coffin was flown to three cities—Ahvaz, the holy city of Mashhad, and then the capital in Tehran—for memorial processions where huge crowds shouted “Death to America” and burned American flags. In Tehran, Suleimani’s daughter, Zeinab, told hundreds of thousands of mourners—Iran claimed millions—that her father’s death would be avenged. “The families of the American soldiers in western Asia&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;will spend their days waiting for the death of their children,” she said, producing cheers. “You crazy Trump, the symbol of ignorance, the slave of Zionists, don’t think that the killing of my father will finish everything.”\n\nSuleimani’s death plays to a central concept of Shiite Islam—martyrdom by a minority fighting for survival against bigger rivals—that dates back to the founding of Islam’s second branch, in the seventh century. The fury has unified disparate sectors of Iranian society, which just weeks ago was riven by street protests challenging the government in dozens of cities.\n\nPresident Hassan Rouhani, who won an upset victory seven years ago, after calling for diplomacy with the United States to end tensions over Iran’s nuclear program, issued a [scathing warning](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50991810) during a condolence call with Suleimani’s family over the weekend. “The Americans really did not realize what a grave error they have committed,” he said. “Revenge for his blood will be exacted on that day when the filthy hands of America will be cut off forever from the region.” Iran’s information and telecommunications minister, Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi, denounced Trump as “a terrorist in a suit.”\n\nOn Monday, General Amir Ali Hajizadeh warned that Iran would retaliate on multiple fronts. “Firing a couple of missiles, hitting a base, or even killing Trump is not valuable enough to compensate for martyr Suleimani’s blood,” he said, on state-controlled television. “The only thing that can compensate for his blood is the complete removal of America from the region and taking away their evil from the oppressed people of the region.” A senior Revolutionary Guard general, Gholamali Abuhamzeh, said that Iran had identified [thirty-five U.S. targets](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2020/01/04/2174109/vital-american-targets-in-region-within-reach-iranian-commander) in the region, and also others in Israel and the oil-exporting lanes in the Persian Gulf. “The Strait of Hormuz is a vital thoroughfare for the West, and a large number of American destroyers and warships cross the Strait of Hormuz, the Sea of Oman, and the Persian Gulf,” he said.\n\nIran also announced that it would no longer limit the number of centrifuges used to enrich uranium, the fuel to make a nuclear weapon. The limit was a key part of the historic Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (J.C.P.O.A.) nuclear deal, brokered in 2015, between Iran and the world’s six major powers. Trump withdrew the United States, unilaterally, in May, 2018, and re-imposed sanctions six months later. The other five countries—Britain, China, France, Germany, and Russia—stuck to the terms. But in mid-2019 Iran began gradually to breach its commitments, on the grounds that it was not receiving the economic benefits promised in the deal. This is its fifth breach. The deal is still not dead. “If the United States and Iran are genuinely interested in de-escalation, it is still possible for the U.S. and Iran to return to compliance with their J.C.P.O.A. commitments,” Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, told me. The Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, tweeted that all five steps were “reversible upon EFFECTIVE implementation of reciprocal obligations.” The verbal warfare between the United States and Iran is increasingly playing out in all caps on Twitter. Zarif noted, however, that Tehran would continue to coöperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog that closely monitors aspects of Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nAs tensions escalated and more than three thousand new U.S. troops began deploying to the region, President Trump spent the weekend playing golf at his Mar-a-Lago resort, in Florida, and spewing threats on Twitter in his spare time. On Saturday, he vowed to strike fifty-two Iranian targets—“some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture”—if Iran targets Americans or U.S. assets. “Those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD,” he added. “The USA wants no more threats!” he tweeted. The choice of fifty-two is from the fifty-two Americans held hostage after the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, in 1979.\n\nTrump’s threat infuriated John Limbert, a former hostage and the political officer at the last U.S. Embassy in Tehran. “I don’t want any part of this,” he told me, on Sunday night. “If [Trump’s] doing this in my name, don’t bother. It’s absurd. He’s using what happened to us for his own misguided action.” I asked him if Iran would be intimidated by Trump’s Twitter bravado. “I don’t think so,” Limbert, who until recently taught at the U.S. Naval Academy, said. “They expect to be bullied and threatened, particularly by the United States. It’s been happening for forty years. They shrug it off.”\n\nDestroying cultural sites is actually a violation of the Geneva Convention—and a war crime. Previous U.S. administrations have roundly condemned the Taliban’s destruction of the Grand Buddhas of Bamiyan, from the seventh century B.C., in Afghanistan, and *ISIS*{: .small}’s destruction of the first-century Temple of Bel, in Syria’s historic Palmyra. Iran, the former Persia, has dozens of sites, such as Persepolis, that date back millennia. On Sunday, Zarif tweeted, in English, “A reminder to those hallucinating about emulating *ISIS*{: .small} war crimes by targeting our cultural heritage: Through MILLENNIA of history, barbarians have come and ravaged our cities, razed our monuments and burnt our libraries. Where are they now? We’re still here, & standing tall.”\n\nPompeo tried to roll back Trump’s threat about attacks on cultural targets. “We’ll behave lawfully,” he said, on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.” But the President went at it again on Air Force One on Sunday night, en route back to Washington after a seventeen-day vacation. “They’re allowed to kill our people,” he [told](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/05/us/politics/trump-iran-cultural-sites.html) reporters travelling with him. “They’re allowed to torture and maim our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we’re not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn’t work that way.”\n\nThe President also threatened to impose “very big sanctions on Iraq” if it did force U.S. troops to withdraw. “If we don’t do it in a very friendly basis, we will charge them sanctions like they’ve never seen before, ever,” he said, on Air Force One. “It’ll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame.” He warned Baghdad, as well, that it would have to compensate the United States financially. “We have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that’s there,” he said. “It cost billions of dollars to build. Long before my time. We’re not leaving unless they pay us back for it.”\n\nThe Administration still has not detailed the nature of the threat that led Trump to order the U.S. air strike that killed Suleimani and the leader of a prominent Iraqi militia in Baghdad last week. Democrats will introduce war-powers resolutions in both the House and the Senate this week, to “to limit the President’s military actions regarding Iran,” House Speaker [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/nancy-pelosi), of California, [told](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pelosi-says-house-will-vote-on-war-powers-resolution-this-week/) her caucus in a letter on Sunday. The resolution “reasserts Congress’s long-established oversight responsibilities by mandating that if no further Congressional action is taken, the Administration’s military hostilities with regard to Iran cease within thirty days.” Senator Tim Kaine, of Virginia, is introducing a similar resolution in the Senate. On Saturday, the White House did meet the forty-eight-hour deadline required by the 1973 War Powers Act to submit formal notification for the introduction of U.S. armed forces. But Pelosi [said](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pelosi-says-house-will-vote-on-war-powers-resolution-this-week/) that the notification “raises more questions than it answers.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This document prompts serious and urgent questions about the timing, manner, and justification of the Administration’s decision to engage in hostilities against Iran.”\n\nIn Washington, there’s an unnerving breathlessness over the rapidity of the deepening crisis with Iran—with no clear strategy for next steps outlined by the Administration, much less an exit strategy. At least for now, diplomacy seems to be off the table, despite President Trump’s repeated statements that he wants talks with Iran on a new nuclear deal to avoid conflict. In the meantime, any of the alternatives could make the United States far less safe than it was ten days ago. On Friday, General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was asked about the dangers to the United States after killing Suleimani. “Is there risk?” he [asked](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-security-usa-milley/top-us-general-soleimani-was-planning-campaign-of-violence-against-us-idUSKBN1Z222T) reporters at the Pentagon. “Damn

The assassination was the boldest U.S. act in confronting Iran since the 1979 revolution, tantamount to an act of war. A brief statement from the Pentagon described it as a “decisive defensive action” designed to protect U.S. personnel abroad. But the strike represented a stunning escalation between Washington and Tehran, and it may well have the reverse effect. Iran almost certainly will want to respond in some lethal form, whether directly or through its powerful network of proxies in the region. U.S. embassies and military bases—and thousands of American personnel across the Middle East and South Asia, and potentially beyond—were instantly vulnerable. On Friday, the State Department ordered all Americans to leave Iraq.\n\nOn Friday, Iran’s Supreme Leader, [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ali-khamenei), declared three days of public mourning and warned that “harsh vengeance awaits those criminals behind martyrdom of General Suleimani.” He moved quickly to name Brigadier General Esmail Gha’ani, who had worked closely with Suleimani, as the new Quds Force commander. Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s U.S.-educated Foreign Minister, who spent two years negotiating the 2015 nuclear deal with the United States, called the American air strike an act of international terrorism. “The US bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism,” he tweeted. Iran’s state-controlled television characterized the assassination as the U.S.’s “biggest miscalculation” since the Second World War. “The people of the region will no longer allow Americans to stay,” it [said](https://apnews.com/5597ff0f046a67805cc233d5933a53ed).\n\nIran’s revolutionary regime often makes boastful threats, but the murder of Suleimani alarmed veteran U.S. military and diplomatic officials who have served in the Middle East. “It is almost impossible to overstate the importance of this,” the retired general David Petraeus, who led U.S. forces in Iraq and later served as the director of the C.I.A., told me. Suleimani was Petraeus’s nemesis during the eight-year U.S. war in Iraq. “Iran has to be in shock right now. Its version of the National Security Council will be on overdrive,” he said. “But there’s a whole universe of possibilities now, everything from proxy retaliation, kidnappings of American citizens, actions against coalition partners, even an attempt to do something in the U.S. We certainly have large force concentrations in the region, too.”\n\nWas the U.S. attack an act of war? Douglas Silliman, who was the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq until last winter and is now the president of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, told me that the death of Suleimani was the equivalent of Iran killing the commander of U.S. military operations in the Middle East and South Asia. “If Iran had killed the commander of U.S. Central Command, what would we consider it to be?” he said. John Limbert, one of fifty-two Americans who were taken hostage in Iran in 1979, told me that he was happy Suleimani was gone, but quickly added, “This is not going to end well.”\n\nSuleimani, a flamboyant former [construction worker](https://apnews.com/3bb7af59e8b1bfd3e15222a98395ee85) and bodybuilder with snowy white hair, a dapper beard, and arching salt-and-pepper eyebrows, gained notice during the eight-year war with Iraq, in the nineteen eighties. He rose through the Revolutionary Guard to become head of the Quds Force—an Iranian unit of commandos comparable to the U.S. *SEAL*{: .small}s, Delta Force, and Rangers combined—in 1998\\. He was the most feared and most admired military leader in the region. He famously rallied followers with flowery jihadi rhetoric about the glories of martyrdom. “The war front is mankind’s lost paradise,” Suleimani was quoted as saying, in 2009\\. “One type of paradise that is portrayed for mankind is streams, beautiful nymphs and greeneries. But there is another kind of paradise.” The front, he said, was “the lost paradise of the human beings.” Thousands of followers died under his leadership.\n\nOver more than two decades, Suleimani, a Shiite, had more impact than the leaders of either Al Qaeda or *ISIS*{: .small}, which are both Sunni movements, in shaping the face of the Middle East. To counter U.S. influence in Iraq between 2003 and 2011, he provided Iraqi militants with rockets, bombs, and explosively formed projectiles that could slice through the armor of an American M1 tank. “He has the blood of hundreds of Americans on his hands,” Petraeus said. The United States designated the Quds Force as a supporter of terrorism, in 2007, and Suleimani was personally sanctioned for complicity in a plot to kill the Saudi Ambassador to the United States, in 2011\\. That same year, he spearheaded a campaign, now in its ninth year, to save President Bashar al-Assad’s regime after civil war erupted in Syria. Suleimani also channelled arms and aid to Hezbollah in Lebanon, orchestrating its franchise operations in other Middle Eastern countries, and aided Houthi rebels in Yemen. He cultivated militia proxies in Pakistan and Afghanistan, thousands of whose members were deployed to fight in Syria. Suleimani gained fame for taking selfies—later posted on social media—on the front lines of regional conflicts where his Quds Force and their allies were deployed. Many went [viral](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2016/0215/Gen.-Soleimani-A-new-brand-of-Iranian-hero-for-nationalist-times).\n\n“I think people in the region saw him as untouchable,” Petraeus said. The only person more powerful in Iran was the Supreme Leader. And, in the Shiite region of the Middle East, there may have been no one more powerful than Suleimani when it came to tangible impact.\n\n“The US just killed Iran’s Patton,” Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group, tweeted shortly after the Pentagon issued its statement. Silliman said that Suleimani led a “huge and largely successful strategic advance by Iran through Iraq and Syria and Lebanon.” \n\nAfter initially operating in the shadows, Suleimani grew rhetorically audacious in the past decade. In 2008, as the U.S. and Iran competed for influence in Iraq, the Iranian general relayed a verbal message to Petraeus through the then Iraqi President, Jalal Talabani, which said, “Dear General Petraeus, you should know that I, Qassem Suleimani, control the policy for Iran with respect to Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza and Afghanistan.” Suleimani’s point, Petraeus told me, was that the Americans had to deal with him—everywhere.\n\nIn 2018, Suleimani famously responded to the [warning](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/23/politics/trump-iran-intl/index.html) that Trump issued to the Iranian President, Hassan Rouhani. Trump, after a weekend at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, tweeted, “NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH.” Suleimani belittled Trump. “It is beneath the dignity of our President to respond to you,” he said, in a speech. “We are near you, where you can’t even imagine. We are ready. We are the man of this arena.”\n\nWhen Suleimani was killed, Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago resort, in Palm Beach. Displaying rare restraint, he merely [posted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) an American flag on his Twitter account.\n\nIn its statement, the Pentagon charged that Suleimani had, in recent months, orchestrated attacks on bases used by U.S. and allied nations as part of an international coalition fighting *ISIS*{: .small}. He “was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region,” the Pentagon said.\n\nSuleimani’s death capped a week of hostilities that escalated with lightning speed after a U.S. military contractor was killed in a rocket attack by Kata’ib Hezbollah, one of the most powerful Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, on December 27th. The attack was the group’s eleventh in recent weeks, the U.S. claimed. On December 29th, the Pentagon responded with [five air strikes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-strikes-shiamilitia-targets-in-iraq-and-syria-11577642168)—three in Iraq and two in Syria—on Kata’ib Hezbollah’s bases. The group’s supporters responded by attacking the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, which is the largest and most fortified diplomatic mission in the world.\n\n“General Suleimani also approved the attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that took place this week,” and the attacks on coalition bases in recent months, the Pentagon said, in its statement. It said that the assassination was aimed at deterring future Iranian assaults, noting pointedly, “The United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the world.”\n\nKata’ib Hezbollah has been an increasingly important militia since it emerged, under Iranian tutelage, in 2004\\. After *ISIS*{: .small} swept through Iraq, in 2014, it merged with dozens of other Shiite militias in the Popular Mobilization Forces to fight the Islamic State caliphate—with Iranian aid, arms, and Suleimani’s strategic advice. *ISIS*{: .small} was the one issue on which Iran and the U.S. had common cause. Along with the rest of the P.M.F., Kata’ib Hezbollah was incorporated into the Iraqi military, in 2019, yet it continued to carry out its own operations—in defiance of the government and to the frustration of the United States. The militia has also been deployed in Syria as part of Iran’s support for the Assad regime. \n\nThe Pentagon provided no initial details on how the attack played out, but the Iranian media [reported](https://en.irna.ir/news/83618278/Senior-IRGC-commander-Qasem-Soleimani-martyred-in-Iraq) that Suleimani had just arrived at the Baghdad airport from Lebanon. The U.S. strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the leader of Kata’ib Hezbollah and deputy chief of the P.M.F. He was “by far the most important P.M.F. leader tied to Iran,” Silliman told me. Iranian news agencies said that Suleimani and Muhandis were leaving the airport in separate cars when both were attacked by rockets fired from a U.S. helicopter. The Tasnim news agency, which has been tied to the Revolutionary Guard in the past, tweeted a photo of a bloodied hand wearing a large ring with an oval red stone, which Suleimani was often photographed wearing. The ring was how his body was [identified](https://www.foxnews.com/world/top-iranian-general-killed-by-u-s-airstrike-had-to-be-identified-by-his-ring-iraqi-officials), Iraqi officials said. \n\nThe timing was particularly awkward for the Iraqi government, which has long attempted a delicate balancing act between neighboring Iran and the United States. Since October 1st, protests have swept across the country demanding the ouster of the Prime Minister and the entire political class, and an end to corruption and economic inequality. The protests have also been noteworthy because of their unprecedented demonstrations against Iran’s influence in Iraq. In November, protesters set fire to Iranian diplomatic missions in the Shiite holy cities of Najaf and Karbala.\n\nThe U.S. killing of Suleimani and the air strikes on Kata’ib Hezbollah over the weekend are an embarrassment to Iraqi leaders and a challenge to Iraqi sovereignty. They come at a time when Baghdad is gripped by the deepest political crisis since the U.S. invasion ousted Saddam Hussein, in 2003\\. The Prime Minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, a Shiite who spent years in exile in Iran, stepped down and is now playing only a caretaker role. There are already calls for the Iraqi parliament to demand the withdrawal of some five thousand U.S. troops—and hundreds more from more than a dozen coalition neighbors—that are still waging a campaign against *ISIS*{: .small} insurgents. In a tweet, in Arabic, Mahdi called the assassination of Suleimani an act of aggression against the “Iraqi state, its government, and its people.” In an ominous signal to Washington, he said the killing was a “breach of the conditions for the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq.” The Iraqi Parliament is due to debate the U.S. military presence and vote on whether it should continue when it reconvenes, but the Prime Minister has the ultimate say as Commander-in-Chief, Silliman said. \n\nThe reaction in Washington played out largely along party lines. Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican of Arkansas and staunch Trump supporter and military veteran, tweeted that Suleimani “got what he richly deserved, and all those American soldiers who died by his hand also got what they deserved: justice.” But top Democrats warned of the fallout—and future cost in American lives. The House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, of California, said that the assassination “risks provoking further dangerous escalation of violence. America—and the world—cannot afford to have tensions escalate to the point of no return.” She and other Democrats charged that Trump attacked a high-level Iranian official without congressional authorization for the use of military force. Tom Udall, a Democrat from New Mexico and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, warned, “Such a reckless escalation of hostilities is likely a violation of Congress’s war-making authority—as well as our basing agreement with Iraq—putting U.S. forces and citizens in danger and very possibly sinking us into another disastrous war in the Middle East that the American people are not asking for and do not support.”\n\nIronically, Suleimani died in just the kind of covert operation that he orchestrated against the United States so often over so many years, with such deadly success. Yet, in his statement on the general’s death, Iran’s supreme leader warned, “His departure to God does not end his path or his mission.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8841e4c73c088d777c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Iran","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"iran"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e2710c62d10815417","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Iraq","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"iraq"},{"id":"5c2e1c8b2710c62d1081542e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Middle East","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"middle-east"},{"id":"5c2e1eaaee7fe02cbd16352d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Shiites","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"shiites"},{"id":"5c2e1eaa41e4c73c088d797d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Sunnis","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"sunnis"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8a54e65be2f29d55eb2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Robin Wright has been a contributing writer to *The New Yorker* since\n1988.

One thing is clear: we’re entering a dangerous period, in which the conflict between the two countries could easily spin out of control. \n\nSuleimani’s biography as a pivotal figure in Iran and the region is [well known](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/30/the-shadow-commander). Since the late nineteen-nineties, he was engaged in trying to remake the Middle East to Iran’s advantage, directing his proxies to kill or dispatch anyone who impeded his vision of an Iranian-dominated sphere of influence stretching from Tehran to the Mediterranean Sea. He was remarkably successful, legendary even—certainly the most influential operative in the region in modern times. He was involved in sponsoring terrorist attacks, propping up despots like Bashar al-Assad in Syria, helping to assassinate at least one foreign leader—the Prime Minister of Lebanon, [Rafik Hariri](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/lebanons-tragic-hero)—and killing hundreds of American soldiers along the way. In the latter years of the American war in Iraq, Suleimani’s militias deployed a particularly bloody weapon against U.S. soldiers—the “explosively formed penetrator,” or E.F.P.—which tore through the armor of U.S. military vehicles and wreaked havoc on soldiers and marines. It was no small irony that he died on the road to the Baghdad International Airport, where so many Americans soldiers and Iraqis died by ambush.\n\nSuleimani’s death is a heavy blow to the Iranian regime. He was not just the central figure in the country’s foreign policy and military; he was also considered a pillar of the Revolution itself. Since 1979, Iran has regarded its defense against foreign enemies, particularly the United States, as central to its survival. Suleimani’s vision of the region was formed in the nineteen-eighties, during the Iran-Iraq War, which left more than a million people dead and for which the Iranians, not entirely without reason, blamed the U.S. and its allies. Suleimani, a veteran of that war, vowed that nothing like it would happen to Iran again, and he built the Quds Force—a wing of the Revolutionary Guard—into a small, mobile army capable of waging asymmetric warfare against the country’s enemies, including the United States. When I asked Ryan Crocker, a veteran American diplomat, what motivated Suleimani, he said that it was love of country—and also something more visceral: “Nationalism drives him, and the love of the fight.”\n\nU.S. officials from previous Administrations have said that Suleimani did not live as a well-guarded recluse like Osama bin Laden, in Pakistan, and the military could have killed him; but the U.S. decided that it was not worth provoking a large-scale retaliation. “Suleimani was lucky,’’ Meir Dagan, the former head of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, once told me. “It’s important to be lucky.” (Dagan died in 2016\\.) \n\n\n+++inset-right\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5e0fde9f8ff5c200086a0dcf]||||||\n+++\n\n\nSuleimani has been replaced by his longtime deputy, but it’s not clear that any commander in Iran is his equal in guile or status. He was as skilled in diplomacy as he was on the battlefield, and as comfortable with diplomats as he was with front-line soldiers, whom he adored. And he had an especially close relationship with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s Supreme Leader. “A guy like Suleimani—they don’t have any more like him,’’ John Maguire, a twenty-three-year veteran of the C.I.A. specializing in the Middle East, told me. Maguire is one of the few Americans ever to come to face to face with Suleimani. They met in Baghdad, in 2004, when Iraqi politicians were trying to broker a rapprochement between the U.S. and Iran. “He had a command presence,” Maguire said. “He walked into the room and you could feel him.”\n\nIn Iraq, Suleimani had four deputies, who helped oversee the Shiite militias who have, most recently, been leading demonstrations against the American Embassy. The leader of one of those militias, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, of Kata’ib Hezbollah, died in the same strike as Suleimani. Muhandis has a long record of attacking Americans, too, beginning with the bombing of the American and French Embassies in Kuwait, in 1983\\. Kata’ib Hezbollah—an organization backed, trained, armed, and directed by Suleimani—is responsible for the deaths of scores of American soldiers in Iraq. Ever since the Trump Administration walked away from the [nuclear deal](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/iran-nuclear-deal) signed under the Obama Administration, the U.S. and Iran have engaged in a series of provocative acts. By killing Suleimani, the Trump Administration has risked a wider, more unpredictable conflict, which could flare in many places and in many ways. It’s hard to imagine that the Iranian regime won’t respond to the American strike—it will feel that it has to. But where, and how? Maguire told me that the Quds Force has long specialized in two tactics: hostage-taking and truck-bombing. But the Americans are so well fortified in Iraq (and across the Middle East), and the American military presence in Iraq is so robust, that it’s more possible that the Iranians, if they decide to retaliate, will do so elsewhere. “It’s a better bet that they will choose another place—somewhere where the Americans are not as well protected,’’ he said. Maguire told me that he is not convinced that the Iranians will respond right away, or even at all, because of the deep sense of shock of losing Suleimani. “It’s a body blow to the regime,’’ he said. The biggest danger, of course, is that the Iranians respond, and possibly miscalculate, and then the United States does the same. That’s how wars start.\n\nPresident Trump said on Friday, as he has previously, that the U.S. is not seeking war or regime change in Iran. Yet, since taking office, the Trump Administration has made regime change its implicit policy. By pulling out of the Iranian nuclear accord and imposing crippling sanctions on the country, Trump’s advisers have wagered that they can bring the regime down. By killing Suleimani, the Administration has taken the fight directly to its leadership.

The assassination was the boldest U.S. act in confronting Iran since the 1979 revolution, tantamount to an act of war. A brief statement from the Pentagon described it as a “decisive defensive action” designed to protect U.S. personnel abroad. But the strike represented a stunning escalation between Washington and Tehran, and it may well have the reverse effect. Iran almost certainly will want to respond in some lethal form, whether directly or through its powerful network of proxies in the region. U.S. embassies and military bases—and thousands of American personnel across the Middle East and South Asia, and potentially beyond—were instantly vulnerable. On Friday, the State Department ordered all Americans to leave Iraq.\n\nOn Friday, Iran’s Supreme Leader, [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ali-khamenei), declared three days of public mourning and warned that “harsh vengeance awaits those criminals behind martyrdom of General Suleimani.” He moved quickly to name Brigadier General Esmail Gha’ani, who had worked closely with Suleimani, as the new Quds Force commander. Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s U.S.-educated Foreign Minister, who spent two years negotiating the 2015 nuclear deal with the United States, called the American air strike an act of international terrorism. “The US bears responsibility for all consequences of its rogue adventurism,” he tweeted. Iran’s state-controlled television characterized the assassination as the U.S.’s “biggest miscalculation” since the Second World War. “The people of the region will no longer allow Americans to stay,” it [said](https://apnews.com/5597ff0f046a67805cc233d5933a53ed).\n\nIran’s revolutionary regime often makes boastful threats, but the murder of Suleimani alarmed veteran U.S. military and diplomatic officials who have served in the Middle East. “It is almost impossible to overstate the importance of this,” the retired general David Petraeus, who led U.S. forces in Iraq and later served as the director of the C.I.A., told me. Suleimani was Petraeus’s nemesis during the eight-year U.S. war in Iraq. “Iran has to be in shock right now. Its version of the National Security Council will be on overdrive,” he said. “But there’s a whole universe of possibilities now, everything from proxy retaliation, kidnappings of American citizens, actions against coalition partners, even an attempt to do something in the U.S. We certainly have large force concentrations in the region, too.”\n\nWas the U.S. attack an act of war? Douglas Silliman, who was the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq until last winter and is now the president of the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, told me that the death of Suleimani was the equivalent of Iran killing the commander of U.S. military operations in the Middle East and South Asia. “If Iran had killed the commander of U.S. Central Command, what would we consider it to be?” he said. John Limbert, one of fifty-two Americans who were taken hostage in Iran in 1979, told me that he was happy Suleimani was gone, but quickly added, “This is not going to end well.”\n\nSuleimani, a flamboyant former [construction worker](https://apnews.com/3bb7af59e8b1bfd3e15222a98395ee85) and bodybuilder with snowy white hair, a dapper beard, and arching salt-and-pepper eyebrows, gained notice during the eight-year war with Iraq, in the nineteen eighties. He rose through the Revolutionary Guard to become head of the Quds Force—an Iranian unit of commandos comparable to the U.S. *SEAL*{: .small}s, Delta Force, and Rangers combined—in 1998\\. He was the most feared and most admired military leader in the region. He famously rallied followers with flowery jihadi rhetoric about the glories of martyrdom. “The war front is mankind’s lost paradise,” Suleimani was quoted as saying, in 2009\\. “One type of paradise that is portrayed for mankind is streams, beautiful nymphs and greeneries. But there is another kind of paradise.” The front, he said, was “the lost paradise of the human beings.” Thousands of followers died under his leadership.\n\nOver more than two decades, Suleimani, a Shiite, had more impact than the leaders of either Al Qaeda or *ISIS*{: .small}, which are both Sunni movements, in shaping the face of the Middle East. To counter U.S. influence in Iraq between 2003 and 2011, he provided Iraqi militants with rockets, bombs, and explosively formed projectiles that could slice through the armor of an American M1 tank. “He has the blood of hundreds of Americans on his hands,” Petraeus said. The United States designated the Quds Force as a supporter of terrorism, in 2007, and Suleimani was personally sanctioned for complicity in a plot to kill the Saudi Ambassador to the United States, in 2011\\. That same year, he spearheaded a campaign, now in its ninth year, to save President Bashar al-Assad’s regime after civil war erupted in Syria. Suleimani also channelled arms and aid to Hezbollah in Lebanon, orchestrating its franchise operations in other Middle Eastern countries, and aided Houthi rebels in Yemen. He cultivated militia proxies in Pakistan and Afghanistan, thousands of whose members were deployed to fight in Syria. Suleimani gained fame for taking selfies—later posted on social media—on the front lines of regional conflicts where his Quds Force and their allies were deployed. Many went [viral](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2016/0215/Gen.-Soleimani-A-new-brand-of-Iranian-hero-for-nationalist-times).\n\n“I think people in the region saw him as untouchable,” Petraeus said. The only person more powerful in Iran was the Supreme Leader. And, in the Shiite region of the Middle East, there may have been no one more powerful than Suleimani when it came to tangible impact.\n\n“The US just killed Iran’s Patton,” Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group, tweeted shortly after the Pentagon issued its statement. Silliman said that Suleimani led a “huge and largely successful strategic advance by Iran through Iraq and Syria and Lebanon.” \n\nAfter initially operating in the shadows, Suleimani grew rhetorically audacious in the past decade. In 2008, as the U.S. and Iran competed for influence in Iraq, the Iranian general relayed a verbal message to Petraeus through the then Iraqi President, Jalal Talabani, which said, “Dear General Petraeus, you should know that I, Qassem Suleimani, control the policy for Iran with respect to Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza and Afghanistan.” Suleimani’s point, Petraeus told me, was that the Americans had to deal with him—everywhere.\n\nIn 2018, Suleimani famously responded to the [warning](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/23/politics/trump-iran-intl/index.html) that Trump issued to the Iranian President, Hassan Rouhani. Trump, after a weekend at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, tweeted, “NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH.” Suleimani belittled Trump. “It is beneath the dignity of our President to respond to you,” he said, in a speech. “We are near you, where you can’t even imagine. We are ready. We are the man of this arena.”\n\nWhen Suleimani was killed, Trump was at his Mar-a-Lago resort, in Palm Beach. Displaying rare restraint, he merely [posted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) an American flag on his Twitter account.\n\nIn its statement, the Pentagon charged that Suleimani had, in recent months, orchestrated attacks on bases used by U.S. and allied nations as part of an international coalition fighting *ISIS*{: .small}. He “was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region,” the Pentagon said.\n\nSuleimani’s death capped a week of hostilities that escalated with lightning speed after a U.S. military contractor was killed in a rocket attack by Kata’ib Hezbollah, one of the most powerful Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, on December 27th. The attack was the group’s eleventh in recent weeks, the U.S. claimed. On December 29th, the Pentagon responded with [five air strikes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-strikes-shiamilitia-targets-in-iraq-and-syria-11577642168)—three in Iraq and two in Syria—on Kata’ib Hezbollah’s bases. The group’s supporters responded by attacking the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, which is the largest and most fortified diplomatic mission in the world.\n\n“General Suleimani also approved the attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that took place this week,” and the attacks on coalition bases in recent months, the Pentagon said, in its statement. It said that the assassination was aimed at deterring future Iranian assaults, noting pointedly, “The United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the world.”\n\nKata’ib Hezbollah has been an increasingly important militia since it emerged, under Iranian tutelage, in 2004\\. After *ISIS*{: .small} swept through Iraq, in 2014, it merged with dozens of other Shiite militias in the Popular Mobilization Forces to fight the Islamic State caliphate—with Iranian aid, arms, and Suleimani’s strategic advice. *ISIS*{: .small} was the one issue on which Iran and the U.S. had common cause. Along with the rest of the P.M.F., Kata’ib Hezbollah was incorporated into the Iraqi military, in 2019, yet it continued to carry out its own operations—in defiance of the government and to the frustration of the United States. The militia has also been deployed in Syria as part of Iran’s support for the Assad regime. \n\nThe Pentagon provided no initial details on how the attack played out, but the Iranian media [reported](https://en.irna.ir/news/83618278/Senior-IRGC-commander-Qasem-Soleimani-martyred-in-Iraq) that Suleimani had just arrived at the Baghdad airport from Lebanon. The U.S. strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the leader of Kata’ib Hezbollah and deputy chief of the P.M.F. He was “by far the most important P.M.F. leader tied to Iran,” Silliman told me. Iranian news agencies said that Suleimani and Muhandis were leaving the airport in separate cars when both were attacked by rockets fired from a U.S. helicopter. The Tasnim news agency, which has been tied to the Revolutionary Guard in the past, tweeted a photo of a bloodied hand wearing a large ring with an oval red stone, which Suleimani was often photographed wearing. The ring was how his body was [identified](https://www.foxnews.com/world/top-iranian-general-killed-by-u-s-airstrike-had-to-be-identified-by-his-ring-iraqi-officials), Iraqi officials said. \n\nThe timing was particularly awkward for the Iraqi government, which has long attempted a delicate balancing act between neighboring Iran and the United States. Since October 1st, protests have swept across the country demanding the ouster of the Prime Minister and the entire political class, and an end to corruption and economic inequality. The protests have also been noteworthy because of their unprecedented demonstrations against Iran’s influence in Iraq. In November, protesters set fire to Iranian diplomatic missions in the Shiite holy cities of Najaf and Karbala.\n\nThe U.S. killing of Suleimani and the air strikes on Kata’ib Hezbollah over the weekend are an embarrassment to Iraqi leaders and a challenge to Iraqi sovereignty. They come at a time when Baghdad is gripped by the deepest political crisis since the U.S. invasion ousted Saddam Hussein, in 2003\\. The Prime Minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, a Shiite who spent years in exile in Iran, stepped down and is now playing only a caretaker role. There are already calls for the Iraqi parliament to demand the withdrawal of some five thousand U.S. troops—and hundreds more from more than a dozen coalition neighbors—that are still waging a campaign against *ISIS*{: .small} insurgents. In a tweet, in Arabic, Mahdi called the assassination of Suleimani an act of aggression against the “Iraqi state, its government, and its people.” In an ominous signal to Washington, he said the killing was a “breach of the conditions for the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq.” The Iraqi Parliament is due to debate the U.S. military presence and vote on whether it should continue when it reconvenes, but the Prime Minister has the ultimate say as Commander-in-Chief, Silliman said. \n\nThe reaction in Washington played out largely along party lines. Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican of Arkansas and staunch Trump supporter and military veteran, tweeted that Suleimani “got what he richly deserved, and all those American soldiers who died by his hand also got what they deserved: justice.” But top Democrats warned of the fallout—and future cost in American lives. The House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, of California, said that the assassination “risks provoking further dangerous escalation of violence. America—and the world—cannot afford to have tensions escalate to the point of no return.” She and other Democrats charged that Trump attacked a high-level Iranian official without congressional authorization for the use of military force. Tom Udall, a Democrat from New Mexico and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, warned, “Such a reckless escalation of hostilities is likely a violation of Congress’s war-making authority—as well as our basing agreement with Iraq—putting U.S. forces and citizens in danger and very possibly sinking us into another disastrous war in the Middle East that the American people are not asking for and do not support.”\n\nIronically, Suleimani died in just the kind of covert operation that he orchestrated against the United States so often over so many years, with such deadly success. Yet, in his statement on the general’s death, Iran’s supreme leader warned, “His departure to God does not end his path or his

They had come to pay their last respects to a fallen comrade. Hassan Shateri, a veteran of Iran’s covert wars throughout the Middle East and South Asia, was a senior commander in a powerful, élite branch of the Revolutionary Guard called the Quds Force. The force is the sharp instrument of Iranian foreign policy, roughly analogous to a combined C.I.A. and Special Forces; its name comes from the Persian word for Jerusalem, which its fighters have promised to liberate. Since 1979, its goal has been to subvert Iran’s enemies and extend the country’s influence across the Middle East. Shateri had spent much of his career abroad, first in Afghanistan and then in Iraq, where the Quds Force helped Shiite militias kill American soldiers.\n\n\n\n\n\nShateri had been killed two days before, on the road that runs between Damascus and Beirut. He had gone to Syria, along with thousands of other members of the Quds Force, to rescue the country’s besieged President, Bashar al-Assad, a crucial ally of Iran. In the past few years, Shateri had worked under an alias as the Quds Force’s chief in Lebanon; there he had helped sustain the armed group Hezbollah, which at the time of the funeral had begun to pour men into Syria to fight for the regime. The circumstances of his death were unclear: one Iranian official said that Shateri had been “directly targeted” by “the Zionist regime,” as Iranians habitually refer to Israel.\n\n+++inset-right\n\n\n----------\n\n*On January 2, 2020, Suleimani was killed on President Trump’s orders. Was this an act of war?* [*Read Robin Wright’s report*](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-us-assassinated-suleimani-the-chief-exporter-of-irans-revolution-but-at-what-price).\n\n----------\n\n\n+++\n\nAt the funeral, the mourners sobbed, and some beat their chests in the Shiite way. Shateri’s casket was wrapped in an Iranian flag, and gathered around it were the commander of the Revolutionary Guard, dressed in green fatigues; a member of the plot to murder four exiled opposition leaders in a Berlin restaurant in 1992; and the father of Imad Mughniyeh, the Hezbollah commander believed to be responsible for the bombings that killed more than two hundred and fifty Americans in Beirut in 1983. Mughniyeh was assassinated in 2008, purportedly by Israeli agents. In the ethos of the Iranian revolution, to die was to serve. Before Shateri’s funeral, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country’s Supreme Leader, released a note of praise: “In the end, he drank the sweet syrup of martyrdom.”\n\n\nKneeling in the second row on the mosque’s carpeted floor was Major General Qassem Suleimani, the Quds Force’s leader: a small man of fifty-six, with silver hair, a close-cropped beard, and a look of intense self-containment. It was Suleimani who had sent Shateri, an old and trusted friend, to his death. As Revolutionary Guard commanders, he and Shateri belonged to a small fraternity formed during the Sacred Defense, the name given to the Iran-Iraq War, which lasted from 1980 to 1988 and left as many as a million people dead. It was a catastrophic fight, but for Iran it was the beginning of a three-decade project to build a Shiite sphere of influence, stretching across Iraq and Syria to the Mediterranean. Along with its allies in Syria and Lebanon, Iran forms an Axis of Resistance, arrayed against the region’s dominant Sunni powers and the West. In Syria, the project hung in the balance, and Suleimani was mounting a desperate fight, even if the price of victory was a sectarian conflict that engulfed the region for years.\n\n\n\nSuleimani took command of the Quds Force fifteen years ago, and in that time he has sought to reshape the Middle East in Iran’s favor, working as a power broker and as a military force: assassinating rivals, arming allies, and, for most of a decade, directing a network of militant groups that killed hundreds of Americans in Iraq. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has sanctioned Suleimani for his role in supporting the Assad regime, and for abetting terrorism. And yet he has remained mostly invisible to the outside world, even as he runs agents and directs operations. “Suleimani is the single most powerful operative in the Middle East today,” John Maguire, a former C.I.A. officer in Iraq, told me, “and no one’s ever heard of him.”\n\n\n\nWhen Suleimani appears in public—often to speak at veterans’ events or to meet with Khamenei—he carries himself inconspicuously and rarely raises his voice, exhibiting a trait that Arabs call _khilib_, or understated charisma. “He is so short, but he has this presence,” a former senior Iraqi official told me. “There will be ten people in a room, and when Suleimani walks in he doesn’t come and sit with you. He sits over there on the other side of room, by himself, in a very quiet way. Doesn’t speak, doesn’t comment, just sits and listens. And so of course everyone is thinking only about him.”\n\n\n\nAt the funeral, Suleimani was dressed in a black jacket and a black shirt with no tie, in the Iranian style; his long, angular face and his arched eyebrows were twisted with pain. The Quds Force had never lost such a high-ranking officer abroad. The day before the funeral, Suleimani had travelled to Shateri’s home to offer condolences to his family. He has a fierce attachment to martyred soldiers, and often visits their families; in a recent interview with Iranian media, he said, “When I see the children of the martyrs, I want to smell their scent, and I lose myself.” As the funeral continued, he and the other mourners bent forward to pray, pressing their foreheads to the carpet. “One of the rarest people, who brought the revolution and the whole world to you, is gone,” Alireza Panahian, the imam, told the mourners. Suleimani cradled his head in his palm and began to weep.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe early months of 2013, around the time of Shateri’s death, marked a low point for the Iranian intervention in Syria. Assad was steadily losing ground to the rebels, who are dominated by Sunnis, Iran’s rivals. If Assad fell, the Iranian regime would lose its link to Hezbollah, its forward base against Israel. In a speech, one Iranian cleric said, “If we lose Syria, we cannot keep Tehran.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the Iranians were severely strained by American sanctions, imposed to stop the regime from developing a nuclear weapon, they were unstinting in their efforts to save Assad. Among other things, they extended a seven-billion-dollar loan to shore up the Syrian economy. “I don’t think the Iranians are calculating this in terms of dollars,” a Middle Eastern security official told me. “They regard the loss of Assad as an existential threat.” For Suleimani, saving Assad seemed a matter of pride, especially if it meant distinguishing himself from the Americans. “Suleimani told us the Iranians would do whatever was necessary,” a former Iraqi leader told me. “He said, ‘We’re not like the Americans. We don’t abandon our friends.’ ”\n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b5e6a0f529324ac0629c8]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, Suleimani asked Kurdish leaders in Iraq to allow him to open a supply route across northern Iraq and into Syria. For years, he had bullied and bribed the Kurds into coöperating with his plans, but this time they rebuffed him. Worse, Assad’s soldiers wouldn’t fight—or, when they did, they mostly butchered civilians, driving the populace to the rebels. “The Syrian Army is useless!” Suleimani told an Iraqi politician. He longed for the Basij, the Iranian militia whose fighters crushed the popular uprisings against the regime in 2009. “Give me one brigade of the Basij, and I could conquer the whole country,” he said. In August, 2012, anti-Assad rebels captured forty-eight Iranians inside Syria. Iranian leaders protested that they were pilgrims, come to pray at a holy Shiite shrine, but the rebels, as well as Western intelligence agencies, said that they were members of the Quds Force. In any case, they were valuable enough so that Assad agreed to release more than two thousand captured rebels to have them freed. And then Shateri was killed.\n\n\n\nFinally, Suleimani began flying into Damascus frequently so that he could assume personal control of the Iranian intervention. “He’s running the war himself,” an American defense official told me. In Damascus, he is said to work out of a heavily fortified command post in a nondescript building, where he has installed a multinational array of officers: the heads of the Syrian military, a Hezbollah commander, and a coördinator of Iraqi Shiite militias, which Suleimani mobilized and brought to the fight. If Suleimani couldn’t have the Basij, he settled for the next best thing: Brigadier General Hossein Hamedani, the Basij’s former deputy commander. Hamedani, another comrade from the Iran-Iraq War, was experienced in running the kind of irregular militias that the Iranians were assembling, in order to keep on fighting if Assad fell.\n\n\n\nLate last year, Western officials began to notice a sharp increase in Iranian supply flights into the Damascus airport. Instead of a handful a week, planes were coming every day, carrying weapons and ammunition—“tons of it,” the Middle Eastern security official told me—along with officers from the Quds Force. According to American officials, the officers coördinated attacks, trained militias, and set up an elaborate system to monitor rebel communications. They also forced the various branches of Assad’s security services—designed to spy on one another—to work together. The Middle Eastern security official said that the number of Quds Force operatives, along with the Iraqi Shiite militiamen they brought with them, reached into the thousands. “They’re spread out across the entire country,” he told me.\n\n\n\nA turning point came in April, after rebels captured the Syrian town of Qusayr, near the Lebanese border. To retake the town, Suleimani called on Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader, to send in more than two thousand fighters. It wasn’t a difficult sell. Qusayr sits at the entrance to the Bekaa Valley, the main conduit for missiles and other matériel to Hezbollah; if it was closed, Hezbollah would find it difficult to survive. Suleimani and Nasrallah are old friends, having coöperated for years in Lebanon and in the many places around the world where Hezbollah operatives have performed terrorist missions at the Iranians’ behest. According to Will Fulton, an Iran expert at the American Enterprise Institute, Hezbollah fighters encircled Qusayr, cutting off the roads, then moved in. Dozens of them were killed, as were at least eight Iranian officers. On June 5th, the town fell. “The whole operation was orchestrated by Suleimani,” Maguire, who is still active in the region, said. “It was a great victory for him.”\n\n\n\nDespite all of Suleimani’s rough work, his image among Iran’s faithful is that of an irreproachable war hero—a decorated veteran of the Iran-Iraq War, in which he became a division commander while still in his twenties. In public, he is almost theatrically modest. During a recent appearance, he described himself as “the smallest soldier,” and, according to the Iranian press, rebuffed members of the audience who tried to kiss his hand. His power comes mostly from his close relationship with Khamenei, who provides the guiding vision for Iranian society. The Supreme Leader, who usually reserves his highest praise for fallen soldiers, has referred to Suleimani as “a living martyr of the revolution.” Suleimani is a hard-line supporter of Iran’s authoritarian system. In July, 1999, at the height of student protests, he signed, with other Revolutionary Guard commanders, a letter warning the reformist President Mohammad Khatami that if he didn’t put down the revolt the military would—perhaps deposing Khatami in the process. “Our patience has run out,” the generals wrote. The police crushed the demonstrators, as they did again, a decade later.\n\n\n\nIran’s government is intensely fractious, and there are many figures around Khamenei who help shape foreign policy, including Revolutionary Guard commanders, senior clerics, and Foreign Ministry officials. But Suleimani has been given a remarkably free hand in implementing Khamenei’s vision. “He has ties to every corner of the system,” Meir Dagan, the former head of Mossad, told me. “He is what I call politically clever. He has a relationship with everyone.” Officials describe him as a believer in Islam and in the revolution; while many senior figures in the Revolutionary Guard have grown wealthy through the Guard’s control over key Iranian industries, Suleimani has been endowed with a personal fortune by the Supreme Leader. “He’s well taken care of,” Maguire said.\n\n\n\nSuleimani lives in Tehran, and appears to lead the home life of a bureaucrat in middle age. “He gets up at four every morning, and he’s in bed by nine-thirty every night,” the Iraqi politician, who has known him for many years, told me, shaking his head in disbelief. Suleimani has a bad prostate and recurring back pain. He’s “respectful of his wife,” the Middle Eastern security official told me, sometimes taking her along on trips. He has three sons and two daughters, and is evidently a strict but loving father. He is said to be especially worried about his daughter Nargis, who lives in Malaysia. “She is deviating from the ways of Islam,” the Middle Eastern official said.\n\n\n\nMaguire told me, “Suleimani is a far more polished guy than most. He can move in political circles, but he’s also got the substance to be intimidating.” Although he is widely read, his aesthetic tastes appear to be strictly traditional. “I don’t think he’d listen to classical music,” the Middle Eastern official told me. “The European thing—I don’t think that’s his vibe, basically.” Suleimani has little formal education, but, the former senior Iraqi official told me, “he is a very shrewd, frighteningly intelligent strategist.” His tools include payoffs for politicians across the Middle East, intimidation when it is needed, and murder as a last resort. Over the years, the Quds Force has built an international network of assets, some of them drawn from the Iranian diaspora, who can be called on to support missions. “They’re everywhere,” a second Middle Eastern security official said. In 2010, according to Western officials, the Quds Force and Hezbollah launched a new campaign against American and Israeli targets—in apparent retaliation for the covert effort to slow down the Iranian nuclear program, which has included cyber attacks and assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists.\n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b5e6c3adc75471b34b145]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nSince then, Suleimani has orchestrated attacks in places as far flung as Thailand, New Delhi, Lagos, and Nairobi—at least thirty attempts in the past two years alone. The most notorious was a scheme, in 2011, to hire a Mexican drug cartel to blow up the Saudi Ambassador to the United States as he sat down to eat at a restaurant a few miles from the White House. The cartel member approached by Suleimani’s agent turned out to be an informant for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. (The Quds Force appears to be more effective close to home, and a number of the remote plans have gone awry.) Still, after the plot collapsed, two former American officials told a congressional committee that Suleimani should be assassinated. “Suleimani travels a lot,” one said. “He is all over the place. Go get him. Either try to capture him or kill him.” In Iran, more than two hundred dignitaries signed an outraged letter in his defense; a social-media campaign proclaimed, “We are all Qassem Suleimani.”\n\n\n\nSeveral Middle Eastern officials, some of whom I have known for a decade, stopped talking the moment I brought up Suleimani. “We don’t want to have any part of this,” a Kurdish official in Iraq said. Among spies in the West, he appears to exist in a special category, an enemy both hated and admired: a Middle Eastern equivalent of Karla, the elusive Soviet master spy in John le Carré’s novels. When I called Dagan, the former Mossad chief, and mentioned Suleimani’s name, there was a long pause on the line. “Ah,” he said, in a tone of weary irony, “a very good friend.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn March, 2009, on the eve of the Iranian New Year, Suleimani led a group of Iran-Iraq War veterans to the Paa-Alam Heights, a barren, rocky promontory on the Iraqi border. In 1986, Paa-Alam was the scene of one of the terrible battles over the Faw Peninsula, where tens of thousands of men died while hardly advancing a step. A video recording from the visit shows Suleimani standing on a mountaintop, recounting the battle to his old comrades. In a gentle voice, he speaks over a soundtrack of music and prayers.\n\n\n\n\n\n“This is the Dasht-e-Abbas Road,” Suleimani says, pointing into the valley below. “This area stood between us and the enemy.” Later, Suleimani and the group stand on the banks of a creek, where he reads aloud the names of fallen Iranian soldiers, his voice trembling with emotion. During a break, he speaks with an interviewer, and describes the fighting in near-mystical terms. “The battlefield is mankind’s lost paradise—the paradise in which morality and human conduct are at their highest,” he says. “One type of paradise that men imagine is about streams, beautiful maidens, and lush landscape. But there is another kind of paradise—the battlefield.”\n\n\n\nSuleimani was born in Rabor, an impoverished mountain village in eastern Iran. When he was a boy, his father, like many other farmers, took out an agricultural loan from the government of the Shah. He owed nine hundred toman—about a hundred dollars at the time—and couldn’t pay it back. In a brief memoir, Suleimani wrote of leaving home with a young relative named Ahmad Suleimani, who was in a similar situation. “At night, we couldn’t fall asleep with the sadness of thinking that government agents were coming to arrest our fathers,” he wrote. Together, they travelled to Kerman, the nearest city, to try to clear their family’s debt. The place was unwelcoming. “We were only thirteen, and our bodies were so tiny, wherever we went, they wouldn’t hire us,” he wrote. “Until one day, when we were hired as laborers at a school construction site on Khajoo Street, which was where the city ended. They paid us two toman per day.” After eight months, they had saved enough money to bring home, but the winter snow was too deep. They were told to seek out a local driver named Pahlavan—“Champion”—who was a “strong man who could lift up a cow or a donkey with his teeth.” During the drive, whenever the car got stuck, “he would lift up the Jeep and put it aside!” In Suleimani’s telling, Pahlavan is an ardent detractor of the Shah. He says of the two boys, “This is the time for them to rest and play, not work as a laborer in a strange city. I spit on the life they have made for us!” They arrived home, Suleimani writes, “just as the lights were coming on in the village homes. When the news travelled in our village, there was pandemonium.”\n\n\n\nAs a young man, Suleimani gave few signs of greater ambition. According to Ali Alfoneh, an Iran expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, he had only a high-school education, and worked for Kerman’s municipal water department. But it was a revolutionary time, and the country’s gathering unrest was making itself felt. Away from work, Suleimani spent hours lifting weights in local gyms, which, like many in the Middle East, offered physical training and inspiration for the warrior spirit. During Ramadan, he attended sermons by a travelling preacher named Hojjat Kamyab—a protégé of Khamenei’s—and it was there that he became inspired by the possibility of Islamic revolution.\n\n\n\nIn 1979, when Suleimani was twenty-two, the Shah fell to a popular uprising led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the name of Islam. Swept up in the fervor, Suleimani joined the Revolutionary Guard, a force established by Iran’s new clerical leadership to prevent the military from mounting a coup. Though he received little training—perhaps only a forty-five-day course—he advanced rapidly. As a young guardsman, Suleimani was dispatched to northwestern Iran, where he helped crush an uprising by ethnic Kurds.\n\n\n\nWhen the revolution was eighteen months old, Saddam Hussein sent the Iraqi Army sweeping across the border, hoping to take advantage of the internal chaos. Instead, the invasion solidified Khomeini’s leadership and unified the country in resistance, starting a brutal, entrenched war. Suleimani was sent to the front with a simple task, to supply water to the soldiers there, and he never left. “I entered the war on a fifteen-day mission, and ended up staying until the end,” he has said. A photograph from that time shows the young Suleimani dressed in green fatigues, with no insignia of rank, his black eyes focussed on a far horizon. “We were all young and wanted to serve the revolution,” he told an interviewer in 2005.\n\n\n\nSuleimani earned a reputation for bravery and élan, especially as a result of reconnaissance missions he undertook behind Iraqi lines. He returned from several missions bearing a goat, which his soldiers slaughtered and grilled. “Even the Iraqis, our enemy, admired him for this,” a former Revolutionary Guard officer who defected to the United States told me. On Iraqi radio, Suleimani became known as “the goat thief.” In recognition of his effectiveness, Alfoneh said, he was put in charge of a brigade from Kerman, with men from the gyms where he lifted weights.\n\n\n\nThe Iranian Army was badly overmatched, and its commanders resorted to crude and costly tactics. In “human wave” assaults, they sent thousands of young men directly into the Iraqi lines, often to clear minefields, and soldiers died at a precipitous rate. Suleimani seemed distressed by the loss of life. Before sending his men into battle, he would embrace each one and bid him goodbye; in speeches, he praised martyred soldiers and begged their forgiveness for not being martyred himself. When Suleimani’s superiors announced plans to attack the Faw Peninsula, he dismissed them as wasteful and foolhardy. The former Revolutionary Guard officer recalled seeing Suleimani in 1985, after a battle in which his brigade had suffered many dead and wounded. He was sitting alone in a corner of a tent. “He was very silent, thinking about the people he’d lost,” the officer said.\n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b5e6e57b86d47b169c215]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nAhmad, the young relative who travelled with Suleimani to Kerman, was killed in 1984. On at least one occasion, Suleimani himself was wounded. Still, he didn’t lose enthusiasm for his work. In the nineteen-eighties, Reuel Marc Gerecht was a young C.I.A. officer posted to Istanbul, where he recruited from the thousands of Iranian soldiers who went there to recuperate. “You’d get a whole variety of guardsmen,” Gerecht, who has written extensively on Iran, told me. “You’d get clerics, you’d get people who came to breathe and whore and drink.” Gerecht divided the veterans into two groups. “There were the broken and the burned out, the hollow-eyed—the guys who had been destroyed,” he said. “And then there were the bright-eyed guys who just couldn’t wait to get back to the front. I’d put Suleimani in the latter category.”\n\n\n\nRyan Crocker, the American Ambassador to Iraq from 2007 to 2009, got a similar feeling. During the Iraq War, Crocker sometimes dealt with Suleimani indirectly, through Iraqi leaders who shuttled in and out of Tehran. Once, he asked one of the Iraqis if Suleimani was especially religious. The answer was “Not really,” Crocker told me. “He attends mosque periodically. Religion doesn’t drive him. Nationalism drives him, and the love of the fight.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIran’s leaders took two lessons from the Iran-Iraq War. The first was that Iran was surrounded by enemies, near and far. To the regime, the invasion was not so much an Iraqi plot as a Western one. American officials were aware of Saddam’s preparations to invade Iran in 1980, and they later provided him with targeting information used in chemical-weapons attacks; the weapons themselves were built with the help of Western European firms. The memory of these attacks is an especially bitter one. “Do you know how many people are still suffering from the effects of chemical weapons?” Mehdi Khalaji, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said. “Thousands of former soldiers. They believe these were Western weapons given to Saddam.” In 1987, during a battle with the Iraqi Army, a division under Suleimani’s command was attacked by artillery shells containing chemical weapons. More than a hundred of his men suffered the effects.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other lesson drawn from the Iran-Iraq War was the futility of fighting a head-to-head confrontation. In 1982, after the Iranians expelled the Iraqi forces, Khomeini ordered his men to keep going, to “liberate” Iraq and push on to Jerusalem. Six years and hundreds of thousands of lives later, he agreed to a ceasefire. According to Alfoneh, many of the generals of Suleimani’s generation believe they could have succeeded had the clerics not flinched. “Many of them feel like they were stabbed in the back,” he said. “They have nurtured this myth for nearly thirty years.” But Iran’s leaders did not want another bloodbath. Instead, they had to build the capacity to wage asymmetrical warfare—attacking stronger powers indirectly, outside of Iran.\n\n\n\nThe Quds Force was an ideal tool. Khomeini had created the prototype for the force in 1979, with the goal of protecting Iran and exporting the Islamic Revolution. The first big opportunity came in Lebanon, where Revolutionary Guard officers were dispatched in 1982 to help organize Shiite militias in the many-sided Lebanese civil war. Those efforts resulted in the creation of Hezbollah, which developed under Iranian guidance. Hezbollah’s military commander, the brilliant and murderous Imad Mughniyeh, helped form what became known as the Special Security Apparatus, a wing of Hezbollah that works closely with the Quds Force. With assistance from Iran, Hezbollah helped orchestrate attacks on the American Embassy and on French and American military barracks. “In the early days, when Hezbollah was totally dependent on Iranian help, Mughniyeh and others were basically willing Iranian assets,” David Crist, a historian for the U.S. military and the author of “The Twilight War,” says.\n\n\n\nFor all of the Iranian regime’s aggressiveness, some of its religious zeal seemed to burn out. In 1989, Khomeini stopped urging Iranians to spread the revolution, and called instead for expediency to preserve its gains. Persian self-interest was the order of the day, even if it was indistinguishable from revolutionary fervor. In those years, Suleimani worked along Iran’s eastern frontier, aiding Afghan rebels who were holding out against the Taliban. The Iranian regime regarded the Taliban with intense hostility, in large part because of their persecution of Afghanistan’s minority Shiite population. (At one point, the two countries nearly went to war; Iran mobilized a quarter of a million troops, and its leaders denounced the Taliban as an affront to Islam.) In an area that breeds corruption, Suleimani made a name for himself battling opium smugglers along the Afghan border.\n\n\n\nIn 1998, Suleimani was named the head of the Quds Force, taking over an agency that had already built a lethal résumé: American and Argentine officials believe that the Iranian regime helped Hezbollah orchestrate the bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in 1992, which killed twenty-nine people, and the attack on the Jewish center in the same city two years later, which killed eighty-five. Suleimani has built the Quds Force into an organization with extraordinary reach, with branches focussed on intelligence, finance, politics, sabotage, and special operations. With a base in the former U.S. Embassy compound in Tehran, the force has between ten thousand and twenty thousand members, divided between combatants and those who train and oversee foreign assets. Its members are picked for their skill and their allegiance to the doctrine of the Islamic Revolution (as well as, in some cases, their family connections). According to the Israeli newspaper _Israel Hayom_, fighters are recruited throughout the region, trained in Shiraz and Tehran, indoctrinated at the Jerusalem Operation College, in Qom, and then “sent on months-long missions to Afghanistan and Iraq to gain experience in field operational work. They usually travel under the guise of Iranian construction workers.”\n\n\n\nAfter taking command, Suleimani strengthened relationships in Lebanon, with Mughniyeh and with Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s chief. By then, the Israeli military had occupied southern Lebanon for sixteen years, and Hezbollah was eager to take control of the country, so Suleimani sent in Quds Force operatives to help. “They had a huge presence—training, advising, planning,” Crocker said. In 2000, the Israelis withdrew, exhausted by relentless Hezbollah attacks. It was a signal victory for the Shiites, and, Crocker said, “another example of how countries like Syria and Iran can play a long game, knowing that we can’t.”\n\n\n\nSince then, the regime has given aid to a variety of militant Islamist groups opposed to America’s allies in the region, such as Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. The help has gone not only to Shiites but also to Sunni groups like Hamas—helping to form an archipelago of alliances that stretches from Baghdad to Beirut. “No one in Tehran started out with a master plan to build the Axis of Resistance, but opportunities presented themselves,” a Western diplomat in Baghdad told me. “In each case, Suleimani was smarter, faster, and better resourced than anyone else in the region. By grasping at opportunities as they came, he built the thing, slowly but surely.” \n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b5e7120855957e69d536f]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn the chaotic days after the attacks of September 11th, Ryan Crocker, then a senior State Department official, flew discreetly to Geneva to meet a group of Iranian diplomats. “I’d fly out on a Friday and then back on Sunday, so nobody in the office knew where I’d been,” Crocker told me. “We’d stay up all night in those meetings.” It seemed clear to Crocker that the Iranians were answering to Suleimani, whom they referred to as “Haji Qassem,” and that they were eager to help the United States destroy their mutual enemy, the Taliban. Although the United States and Iran broke off diplomatic relations in 1980, after American diplomats in Tehran were taken hostage, Crocker wasn’t surprised to find that Suleimani was flexible. “You don’t live through eight years of brutal war without being pretty pragmatic,” he said. Sometimes Suleimani passed messages to Crocker, but he avoided putting anything in writing. “Haji Qassem’s way too smart for that,” Crocker said. “He’s not going to leave paper trails for the Americans.”\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the bombing began, Crocker sensed that the Iranians were growing impatient with the Bush Administration, thinking that it was taking too long to attack the Taliban. At a meeting in early October, 2001, the lead Iranian negotiator stood up and slammed a sheaf of papers on the table. “If you guys don’t stop building these fairy-tale governments in the sky, and actually start doing some shooting on the ground, none of this is ever going to happen!” he shouted. “When you’re ready to talk about serious fighting, you know where to find me.” He stomped out of the room. “It was a great moment,” Crocker said.\n\n\n\nThe coöperation between the two countries lasted through the initial phase of the war. At one point, the lead negotiator handed Crocker a map detailing the disposition of Taliban forces. “Here’s our advice: hit them here first, and then hit them over here. And here’s the logic.” Stunned, Crocker asked, “Can I take notes?” The negotiator replied, “You can keep the map.” The flow of information went both ways. On one occasion, Crocker said, he gave his counterparts the location of an Al Qaeda facilitator living in the eastern city of Mashhad. The Iranians detained him and brought him to Afghanistan’s new leaders, who, Crocker believes, turned him over to the U.S. The negotiator told Crocker, “Haji Qassem is very pleased with our coöperation.”\n\n\n\nThe good will didn’t last. In January, 2002, Crocker, who was by then the deputy chief of the American Embassy in Kabul, was awakened one night by aides, who told him that President George W. Bush, in his State of the Union Address, had named Iran as part of an “Axis of Evil.” Like many senior diplomats, Crocker was caught off guard. He saw the negotiator the next day at the U.N. compound in Kabul, and he was furious. “You completely damaged me,” Crocker recalled him saying. “Suleimani is in a tearing rage. He feels compromised.” The negotiator told Crocker that, at great political risk, Suleimani had been contemplating a complete reëvaluation of the United States, saying, “Maybe it’s time to rethink our relationship with the Americans.” The Axis of Evil speech brought the meetings to an end. Reformers inside the government, who had advocated a rapprochement with the United States, were put on the defensive. Recalling that time, Crocker shook his head. “We were just that close,” he said. “One word in one speech changed history.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nBefore the meetings fell apart, Crocker talked with the lead negotiator about the possibility of war in Iraq. “Look,” Crocker said, “I don’t know what’s going to happen, but I do have some responsibility for Iraq—it’s my portfolio—and I can read the signs, and I think we’re going to go in.” He saw an enormous opportunity. The Iranians despised Saddam, and Crocker figured that they would be willing to work with the U.S. “I was not a fan of the invasion,” he told me. “But I was thinking, If we’re going to do it, let’s see if we can flip an enemy into a friend—at least tactically for this, and then let’s see where we can take it.” The negotiator indicated that the Iranians were willing to talk, and that Iraq, like Afghanistan, was part of Suleimani’s brief: “It’s one guy running both shows.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the invasion began, in March, 2003, Iranian officials were frantic to let the Americans know that they wanted peace. Many of them watched the regimes topple in Afghanistan and Iraq and were convinced that they were next. “They were scared shitless,” Maguire, the former C.I.A. officer in Baghdad, told me. “They were sending runners across the border to our élite elements saying, ‘Look, we don’t want any trouble with you.’ We had an enormous upper hand.” That same year, American officials determined that Iran had reconfigured its plans to develop a nuclear weapon to proceed more slowly and covertly, lest it invite a Western attack.\n\n\n\nAfter Saddam’s regime collapsed, Crocker was dispatched to Baghdad to organize a fledgling government, called the Iraqi Governing Council. He realized that many Iraqi politicians were flying to Tehran for consultations, and he jumped at the chance to negotiate indirectly with Suleimani. In the course of the summer, Crocker passed him the names of prospective Shiite candidates, and the two men vetted each one. Crocker did not offer veto power, but he abandoned candidates whom Suleimani found especially objectionable. “The formation of the governing council was in its essence a negotiation between Tehran and Washington,” he said.\n\n\n\nThat exchange was the high point of Iranian-American coöperation. “After we formed the governing council, everything collapsed,” Crocker said. As the American occupation faltered, Suleimani began an aggressive campaign of sabotage. Many Americans and Iraqis I interviewed thought that the change of strategy was the result of opportunism: the Iranians became aggressive when the fear of an American invasion began to recede.\n\n\n\nFor years, Suleimani had sent operatives into Iraq to cultivate Shiite militias, so, when Saddam fell, he already had a fighting force in place: the Badr Brigade, the armed wing of a Shiite political party called the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq. The Party’s leaders so thoroughly identified with the Iranian revolution that Badr’s militiamen had fought alongside Iranian forces in the Iran-Iraq War.\n\n\n\nThe Badr Brigade spent much of its time carrying out revenge killings against Baathists, and largely held its fire against the Americans. But another Iranian-backed militia—the Mahdi Army, headed by the populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr—began confronting the Americans early. In August, 2004, after the Americans launched a particularly bloody counteroffensive, I walked through a makeshift graveyard in the holy city of Najaf, south of Baghdad, and found dozens of shallow graves, each marked by a tiny glass jar containing a slip of paper with the fallen fighter’s name and address. Many of them were marked “Tehran.”\n\n\n\nSuleimani found Sadr unpredictable and difficult to manage, so the Quds Force began to organize other militias that were willing to attack the Americans. Its operatives trained fighters in Iran, sometimes helped by their comrades in Hezbollah. Suleimani’s control over some of the Iraqi militias at times appeared to be total. At one point, a senior Iraqi official, on a trip to Washington, publicly blamed the Supreme Leader for escalating the violence in Iraq. Soon after returning to Baghdad, he told me, he received messages from the leaders of two Iraqi Shiite militias. Both posed the same question: Do you want to die?\n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b5e721260cf20873dfe07]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2004, the Quds Force began flooding Iraq with lethal roadside bombs that the Americans referred to as E.F.P.s, for “explosively formed projectiles.” The E.F.P.s, which fire a molten copper slug able to penetrate armor, began to wreak havoc on American troops, accounting for nearly twenty per cent of combat deaths. E.F.P.s could be made only by skilled technicians, and they were often triggered by sophisticated motion sensors. “There was zero question where they were coming from,” General Stanley McChrystal, who at the time was the head of the Joint Special Operations Command, told me. “We knew where all the factories were in Iran. The E.F.P.s killed hundreds of Americans.”\n\n\n\nSuleimani’s campaign against the United States crossed the Sunni-Shiite divide, which he has always been willing to set aside for a larger purpose. Iraqi and Western officials told me that, early in the war, Suleimani encouraged the head of intelligence for the Assad regime to facilitate the movement of Sunni extremists through Syria to fight the Americans. In many cases, Al Qaeda was also allowed a degree of freedom in Iran as well. Crocker told me that in May, 2003, the Americans received intelligence that Al Qaeda fighters in Iran were preparing an attack on Western targets in Saudi Arabia. Crocker was alarmed. “They were there, under Iranian protection, planning operations,” he said. He flew to Geneva and passed a warning to the Iranians, but to no avail; militants bombed three residential compounds in Riyadh, killing thirty-five people, including nine Americans.\n\n\n\nAs it turned out, the Iranian strategy of abetting Sunni extremists backfired horrendously: shortly after the occupation began, the same extremists began attacking Shiite civilians and the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government. It was a preview of the civil war to come. “Welcome to the Middle East,” the Western diplomat in Baghdad told me. “Suleimani wanted to bleed the Americans, so he invited in the jihadis, and things got out of control.”\n\n\n\nStill, Iran’s policy toward the Americans in Iraq was not entirely hostile—both countries, after all, were trying to empower Iraq’s Shiite majority—and so Suleimani alternated between bargaining with the Americans and killing them. Throughout the war, he summoned Iraqi leaders to Tehran to broker deals, usually intended to maximize Shiite power. At least once, he even travelled into the heart of American power in Baghdad. “Suleimani came into the Green Zone to meet the Iraqis,” the Iraqi politician told me. “I think the Americans wanted to arrest him, but they figured they couldn’t.”\n\n\n\nAs both sides sought an advantage, the shifting allegiances led to uncomfortable, sometimes bizarre encounters. The leaders of the two main Kurdish parties, Massoud Barzani and Jalal Talabani, met regularly with both Suleimani and the Americans. While the Kurds’ relationship with the U.S. was usually warm, their ties to Iranian leaders like Suleimani were deeper and more complex; the Iranian regime had sheltered Iraq’s Kurds during their war with Saddam. But it was never an equal relationship. Kurdish leaders say that Suleimani’s objective has always been to keep Iraq’s political parties divided and unstable, insuring that the country stayed weak: the Iran-Iraq War was never far from his mind. “It is very difficult for us to say no to Suleimani,” a senior Kurdish official told me. “When we say no, he makes trouble for us. Bombings. Shootings. The Iranians are our neighbors. They’ve always been there, and they always will be. We have to deal with them.”\n\n\n\nA senior intelligence officer in Baghdad recalled visiting Talabani at his house during a trip to northern Iraq. When he walked in, Qassem Suleimani was sitting there, wearing a black shirt and black jacket. The two men looked each other up and down. “He knew who I was; I knew who he was. We shook hands, didn’t say anything,” the officer said. “I’ve never seen Talabani so deferential to anyone. He was terrified.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn the years after the invasion, General McChrystal concentrated on defeating Sunni insurgents, and, like other American commanders in Iraq, he largely refrained from pursuing Quds Force agents. Provoking Iran would only exacerbate the conflict, and, in any case, many of the agents operated under the protection of diplomatic cover. But, as the war dragged on, the Iranian-backed militias loomed ever larger. In late 2006, McChrystal told me, he formed a task force to kill and capture Iranian-backed insurgents, as well as Quds Force operatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat December, American commandos raided the compound of Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, a powerful Shiite politician, and found General Mohsen Chizari, the head of operations for the Quds Force. According to “The Endgame,” by Michael Gordon and Bernard Trainor, the commandos detained Chizari, sending shock waves through Baghdad. “Everybody was stunned,” a former senior military commander told me. “All the Iranians were stunned. We had broken the unwritten law.” Nuri al-Maliki, the Iraqi Prime Minister, demanded that the Americans turn over Chizari. When they did—reluctantly—Maliki released him. After the incident, the American Ambassador told Maliki that the next time they caught an Iranian operative they were going to keep him.\n\n\n\nA month later, McChrystal received reports that General Mohammed Ali Jafari, the head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, might be in a convoy heading toward the Iraqi border. According to other intelligence sources, Suleimani was riding with him. A group of Kurdish fighters were waiting to welcome them when they crossed over. McChrystal decided to allow the Iranians to cross the border. “We didn’t want to get into a gunfight with the Kurds,” he said.\n\n\n\nMcChrystal’s men tracked the convoy as it drove a hundred miles into Iraq, to the Kurdish city of Erbil, and stopped at a nondescript building, which had a small sign that read “Consulate.” No one knew that such a consulate existed, but the fact that it did meant that the men inside were operating under diplomatic cover. The Americans moved in anyway, and took five Iranians into custody. All were carrying diplomatic passports, and all, according to McChrystal, were Quds Force members. Neither Suleimani nor Jafari was there; they had evidently broken off from the convoy at the last minute and taken refuge in a safe house controlled by the Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani. “Suleimani was lucky,” Dagan, the former Mossad chief, told me, referring to the raid. “It’s important to be lucky.”\n\n\n\nNine days later, five new black S.U.V.s pulled up to the gates of the Karbala Provincial Center, in southern Iraq. The men inside spoke English, wore American-style uniforms, and flashed I.D.s, and so they were allowed through the gates. In the compound, they jumped out of their vehicles and ran directly to a building where American soldiers were working. They killed one and captured four, ignoring everyone else. In a few hours, the four captives were dead, shot at close range.\n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b5e743adc75471b34b151]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nThe raid was carried out by Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq, one of the Iranian-backed militias. American officials speculated that Suleimani had ordered the raid, in response to the capture of the Quds Force operatives in Erbil. Within two months, the Americans had killed the alleged leader of the attack and rounded up several of the participants. One of them was Ali Musa Daqduq, a Hezbollah commander who had trained in Iran. At first, Daqduq pretended to be unable to speak, and the Americans nicknamed him Hamid the Mute. But after a time, they said, he started talking, and told them that the operation had been ordered by Iranian officials. For the first time, American commanders publicly pointed to Suleimani. At a press conference, Brigadier General Kevin Bergner said, “The Quds Force knew of and supported planning for the eventual Karbala attack that killed five coalition soldiers.”\n\n\n\nAs the covert war with Iran intensified, American officials considered crossing into Iran to attack training camps and bomb factories. “Some of us wanted very badly to hit them,” a senior American officer who was in Iraq at the time told me. Those debates lasted well into 2011, until the last American soldiers left the country. Each time, the Americans decided against crossing the border, figuring that it would be too easy for the Iranians to escalate the fighting.\n\n\n\nAround the same time, Suleimani struck up a correspondence with senior American officials, sending messages through intermediaries—sometimes seeking to reassure the Americans, sometimes to extract something. One of the first came in early 2008, when the Iraqi President, Jalal Talabani, handed a cell phone with a text message to General David Petraeus, who had taken over the year before as the commander of American forces. “Dear General Petraeus,” the text read, “you should know that I, Qassem Suleimani, control the policy for Iran with respect to Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza and Afghanistan. And indeed, the ambassador in Baghdad is a Quds Force member. The individual who’s going to replace him is a Quds Force member.” After the five American soldiers were killed in Karbala, Suleimani sent a message to the American Ambassador. “I swear on the grave of Khomeini I haven’t authorized a bullet against the U.S.,” Suleimani said. None of the Americans believed him.\n\n\n\nIn a report to the White House, Petraeus wrote that Suleimani was “truly evil.” Yet at times the two men were all but negotiating. According to diplomatic cables revealed by WikiLeaks, Petraeus sent messages through Iraqi officials to Suleimani, asking him to call off rocket attacks on the American Embassy and on U.S. bases. In 2008, the Americans and the Iraqi Army were pressing an offensive against the Mahdi Army—Moqtada al-Sadr’s Shiite militia—and, in retribution, the militia was bombarding the Green Zone regularly. Suleimani, who sensed a political opening, sent Petraeus a message lamenting the situation and saying that he had assigned men to apprehend the attackers. Petraeus replied, “I was born on a Sunday, but it wasn’t last Sunday.” Eventually, Suleimani brokered a ceasefire between Sadr and the government.\n\n\n\nAt times, Suleimani seemed to take pleasure in taunting his American counterparts, and stories of his exploits spread. In the summer of 2006, during the thirty-four-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, the violence in Baghdad appeared to ebb. When the fighting ended, the Iraqi politician told me, Suleimani supposedly sent a message to the American command. “I hope you have been enjoying the peace and quiet in Baghdad,” it read. “I’ve been busy in Beirut!”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn a speech in 1990, Khamenei said that the mission of the Quds Force is to “establish popular Hezbollah cells all over the world.” Although that goal has not been met, Hezbollah has become the most influential force in Lebanon—a military power and a political party that nearly supersedes the state. Some experts on the region believe that it has grown less dependent on Iran as it has matured. But, at a dinner in Beirut last year, Walid Joumblatt, a Lebanese politician, complained that Hezbollah’s leaders were still in thrall to Tehran. “You have to sit and talk with them, but what do you say?” he said to me. “They don’t decide. It’s Khamenei and Qassem Suleimani who decide.”\n\n\n\n\n\nHezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, has endorsed the concept of Velayat-e Faqih, which recognizes Iran’s Supreme Leader as the ultimate authority, and he has acknowledged the presence of Quds Force operatives in Lebanon. From 2000 to 2006, Iran contributed a hundred million dollars a year to Hezbollah. Its fighters are attractive proxies: unlike the Iranians, they speak Arabic, making them better equipped to operate in Syria and elsewhere in the Arab world. Working with the Iranians, they have either launched or prepared to launch attacks in Cyprus, Azerbaijan, and Turkey.\n\n\n\nThey don’t always act together. After a Hezbollah operative attacked a tour bus filled with Israelis in Bulgaria, last July, American authorities learned that Suleimani had asked his subordinates, “Does anyone know about this?” No one did. “Hezbollah acted on its own in that one,” an American defense official told me. Nonetheless, the Quds Force appears to have been involved in a number of the most significant moments in Lebanon’s recent history. In 2006, Nasrallah ordered a group of his fighters to kidnap Israeli soldiers—an operation that the Middle Eastern security official told me was carried out with Suleimani’s help. A brief but fierce war ensued, in which the Israel Defense Forces destroyed much of Lebanon. “I don’t think Suleimani expected that reaction,” the official said.\n\n\n\nThe question of Iranian influence in Lebanon resurfaced in 2011, when the United Nations-backed Special Tribunal for Lebanon charged four senior members of Hezbollah with assassinating the former Lebanese Prime Minister, Rafik Hariri, in 2005. Hariri, a Sunni, had been trying to take Lebanon out of the Iranian-Syrian orbit. On Valentine’s Day, he was killed by a suicide truck bomb whose payload weighed more than five thousand pounds.\n\n\n\nProsecutors identified the alleged Hezbollah assassins by means of “co-location analysis”—matching disposable cell phones used at the time of the murder with other phones that belonged to the suspects. They refrained from indicting Syrian officials, but, they said, they had convincing evidence that Assad’s government was involved in Hariri’s killing. A senior investigator for the Special Tribunal told me that there was also reason to suspect the Iranians: “Our theory of the case was that Hezbollah pulled the trigger, but could not and would not have done so without the blessing and logistical support from both Syria and Iran.” One of the phones believed to have been used by the killers had made at least a dozen calls to Iran before and after the assassination. But investigators told me that they didn’t know who in Iran was called, and that they couldn’t persuade Western intelligence agencies to help them. As it turned out, the agencies knew quite a bit. The senior intelligence officer told me that Iranian operatives were overheard talking minutes before the assassination. “There were Iranians on the phones directing the attack,” he said. Robert Baer, a former senior C.I.A. official, told me, “If indeed Iran was involved, Suleimani was undoubtedly at the center of this.”\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the four Hezbollah suspects in the killing have disappeared. One of them, Mustafa Badreddine—Imad Mughniyeh’s brother-in-law and a longtime Hezbollah bomb maker—was spotted in Syria by the rebels, who say that he is fighting for Assad.\n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b5e76ba20a654ac5d43ca]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nOn December 22, 2010, James Jeffrey, the American Ambassador to Iraq, and General Lloyd Austin, the top American commander there, issued a note of congratulations to the Iraqi people on the formation of a new government, led by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. The country had been without a government for nine months, after parliamentary elections ended in an impasse. The composition of the government was critical; at the time of the election, there were still nearly a hundred thousand American troops in the country, and U.S. commanders were still hoping to leave a residual force behind. “We look forward to working with the new coalition government in furthering our common vision of a democratic Iraq,” the two men said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Jeffrey and Austin didn’t say was that the crucial deal that brought the Iraqi government together was made not by them but by Suleimani. In the months before, according to several Iraqi and Western officials, Suleimani invited senior Shiite and Kurdish leaders to meet with him in Tehran and Qom, and extracted from them a promise to support Maliki, his preferred candidate. The deal had a complex array of enticements. Maliki and Assad disliked each other; Suleimani brought them together by forging an agreement to build a lucrative oil pipeline from Iraq to the Syrian border. In order to bring the cleric Moqtada al-Sadr in line, Suleimani agreed to place his men in the Iraqi service ministries.\n\n\n\nMost remarkable, according to the Iraqi and Western officials, were the two conditions that Suleimani imposed on the Iraqis. The first was that Jalal Talabani, a longtime friend of the Iranian regime, become President. The second was that Maliki and his coalition partners insist that all American troops leave the country. “Suleimani said: no Americans,” the former Iraqi leader told me. “A ten-year relationship, down the drain.”\n\n\n\nIraqi officials told me that, at the time of Jeffrey’s announcement, the Americans knew that Suleimani had pushed them out of the country but were too embarrassed to admit it in public. “We were laughing at the Americans,” the former Iraqi leader told me, growing angry as he recalled the situation. “Fuck it! Fuck it!” he said. “Suleimani completely outmaneuvered them, and in public they were congratulating themselves for putting the government together.”\n\n\n\nThe deal was a heavy blow to Ayad Allawi, a pro-American secular politician whose party had won the most parliamentary seats in the elections, but who failed to put together a majority coalition. In an interview in Jordan, he said that with U.S. backing he could have built a majority. Instead, the Americans pushed him aside in favor of Maliki. He told me that Vice-President Joe Biden called to tell him to abandon his bid for Prime Minister, saying, “You can’t form a government.”\n\n\n\nAllawi said he suspected that the Americans weren’t willing to deal with the trouble the Iranians would have made if he had become Prime Minister. They wanted to stay in Iraq, he said, but only if the effort involved was minimal. “I needed American support,” he said. “But they wanted to leave, and they handed the country to the Iranians. Iraq is a failed state now, an Iranian colony.”\n\n\n\nAccording to American and Iraqi former officials, Suleimani exerts leverage over Iraqi politics by paying officials, by subsidizing newspapers and television stations, and, when necessary, by intimidation. Few are immune to his enticements. “I have yet to see one Shia political party not taking money from Qassem Suleimani,” the former senior Iraqi official told me. “He’s the most powerful man in Iraq, without question.”\n\n\n\nEven Maliki often feels like a prisoner of the Iranians. Exiled by Saddam, Maliki lived for a short time in Iran, but then moved to Syria—in part to escape Iranian influence, Iraqis who know him say. Crocker said that Maliki once told him, “You can’t know what arrogance is until you are an Iraqi Arab forced to take refuge with the Iranians.” The Iraqi politician, who is close to both men, told me that Maliki resents Suleimani, and that the feeling is mutual. “Maliki says Suleimani doesn’t listen,” he told me. “Suleimani says Maliki just lies.”\n\n\n\nStill, Maliki may be amply repaying Suleimani for his efforts to make him Prime Minister. According to the former senior intelligence officer, Maliki’s government is presiding over a number of schemes, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars a year, to help the Iranian regime outwit Western economic sanctions. A prominent Iraqi businessman told me that Iranian-backed agents regularly use the Iraqi banking system to undertake fraudulent transactions that allow them to sell Iraqi currency at a huge profit. “If the banks refuse, they are shut down by the government,” he said.\n\n\n\nThe other main source of revenue for the Iranians is oil, officials say: Maliki’s government sets aside the equivalent of two hundred thousand barrels of oil a day—about twenty million dollars’ worth, at current prices—and sends the money to Suleimani. In this way, the Quds Force has made itself immune to the economic pressures of Western sanctions. “It’s a self-funding covert-action program,” the former senior intelligence officer said. “Suleimani doesn’t even need the Iranian budget to fund his operations.”\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nLast December, when Assad’s regime appeared close to collapse, American officials spotted Syrian technicians preparing bombs carrying the nerve agent sarin to be loaded onto aircraft. All indications were that they were plotting an enormous chemical attack. Frantic, the Americans called leaders in Russia, who called their counterparts in Tehran. According to the American defense official, Suleimani appeared to be instrumental in persuading Assad to refrain from using the weapons.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuleimani’s sentiments about the ethics of chemical weapons are unknown. During the Iran-Iraq War, thousands of Iranian soldiers suffered from chemical attacks, and the survivors still speak publicly of the trauma. But some American officials believe that his efforts to restrain Assad had a more pragmatic inspiration: the fear of provoking American military intervention. “Both the Russians and the Iranians have said to Assad, ‘We can’t support you in the court of world opinion if you use this stuff,’ ” a former senior American military official said.\n\n\n\nThe regime is believed to have used chemical weapons at least fourteen times since last year. Yet even after the enormous sarin attack on August 21st, which killed fourteen hundred civilians, Suleimani’s support for Syria has been unbending. To save Assad, Suleimani has called on every asset he built since taking over the Quds Force: Hezbollah fighters, Shiite militiamen from around the Arab world, and all the money and matériel he could squeeze out of his own besieged government. In Baghdad, a young Iraqi Shiite who called himself Abu Hassan told me that he was recruited to fight by a group of Iraqi men. He took a bus to the Iranian city of Mashhad, where he and three dozen other Iraqis received two weeks of instruction from Iranian trainers. The men travelled to the Shiite shrine of Sayyidah Zaynab, near Damascus, where they spent three months fighting for the Assad government, along with soldiers from Hezbollah and snipers from Iran. “We lost a lot of people,” Abu Hassan told me.\n\n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoons/593b5e770f529324ac0629d0]||||||\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nSuleimani’s greatest achievement may be persuading his proxies in the Iraqi government to allow Iran to use its airspace to fly men and munitions to Damascus. General James Mattis, who until March was the commander of all American military forces in the Middle East, told me that without this aid the Assad regime would have collapsed months ago. The flights are overseen by the Iraqi transportation minister, Hadi al-Amri, who is an old ally of Suleimani’s—the former head of the Badr Brigade, and a soldier on the Iranian side in the Iran-Iraq War. In an interview in Baghdad, Amri denied that the Iranians were using Iraqi airspace to send weapons. But he made clear his affection for his former commander. “I love Qassem Suleimani!” he said, pounding the table. “He is my dearest friend.”\n\n\n\nSo far, Maliki has resisted pressure to supply Assad overland through Iraq. But he hasn’t stopped the flights; the prospect of a radical Sunni regime in Syria overcame his reservations about becoming involved in a civil war. “Maliki dislikes the Iranians, and he loathes Assad, but he _hates_ Al Nusra,” Crocker told me. “He doesn’t want an Al Qaeda government in Damascus.”\n\n\n\nThis kind of starkly sectarian atmosphere may be Suleimani’s most lasting impact on the Middle East. To save his Iranian empire in Syria and Lebanon, he has helped fuel a Sunni-Shiite conflict that threatens to engulf the region for years to come—a war that he appears happy to wage. “He has every reason to believe that Iran is the rising power in the region,” Mattis told me. “We’ve never dealt him a body blow.”\n\n\n\nIn June, a new, moderate President, Hassan Rouhani, was elected in Iran, promising to end the sanctions, which have exhausted the country and demolished its middle class. Hopes have risen in the West that Khamenei might allow Rouhani to strike a deal. Although Rouhani is a moderate only by Iranian standards—he is a Shiite cleric and a longtime adherent of the revolution—his new administration has made a series of good-will gestures, including the release of eleven political prisoners and an exchange of letters with President Obama. Rouhani is in New York this week to speak at the United Nations and, possibly, to meet with Obama. The talks will surely center on the potential for Iran to restrain its nuclear program, in exchange for relaxed sanctions.\n\n\n\nMany in the West are hoping that Iran will also help find an end to the grinding war in Syria. Assad’s deputy prime minister recently offered the possibility of a cease-fire, saying, “Let nobody have any fear that the regime in its present form will continue.” But he did not say that Assad would step down, which the rebels have said is a necessary condition of negotiations. There have been hints from powerful Iranians that Assad isn’t worth holding on to. In a recent speech, the former President Hashemi Rafsanjani said, “The people have been the target of chemical attacks by their own government.” (After a leaked recording of the speech caused a stir in Iran, Rafsanjani denied the remarks.) But a less sympathetic regime in Syria would split the Axis of Resistance, and radically complicate Iran’s partnership with Hezbollah. In any case, the Iranian regime may be too fragmented to come to a consensus. “Anytime you see a statement coming out of the government, just remember there’s a rat’s nest of people fighting underneath the surface,” Kevan Harris, a sociologist at Princeton who has studied Iran extensively, told me. As Rouhani tries to engage the West, he will have to contend with the hard-liners, including Suleimani and his comrades, who for more than a decade have defined their foreign policy as a covert war on the U.S. and Israel. “They don’t trust the other side,” Harris said. “They feel that any concession they make will be seen by the West as a sign of weakness.”\n\n\n\nFor Suleimani, giving up Assad would mean abandoning the project of expansion that has occupied him for fifteen years. In a recent speech before the Assembly of Experts—the clerics who choose the Supreme Leader—he spoke about Syria in fiercely determined language. “We do not pay attention to the propaganda of the enemy, because Syria is the front line of the resistance and this reality is undeniable,’’ he said. “We have a duty to defend Muslims because they are under pressure and oppression.” Suleimani was fighting the same war, against the same foes, that he’d been fighting his entire life; for him, it seemed, the compromises of statecraft could not compare with the paradise of the battlefield. “We will support Syria to the end,” he said. ♦","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/09/30/the-shadow-commander","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1f08b75f002c8941e6b7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"(Gen.)

See, we can make a deal together!” he wrote. The swap was a rare moment of détente following months of escalating hostilities, which came within minutes of a [military confrontation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/trump-ordered-attack-on-iran-for-downing-drone-then-called-it-off/2019/06/21/24f4994e-93f3-11e9-aadb-74e6b2b46f6a_story.html) in June, after Iran shot down a sophisticated U.S. drone.\n\nIt ended the traumatic saga of [Xiyue Wang](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-threat-of-war-brings-new-fears-to-an-american-hostage-in-iran), an American student in the fourth year of a ten-year prison sentence in Iran on two charges of espionage. He had been arrested, in 2016, while doing doctoral research in Tehran’s national archives on the nineteenth and early twentieth century Qajar dynasty. The swap also ended the controversial case of [Masoud Soleimani](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-hostage-drama-in-iran-drags-on-forty-years-later), an Iranian stem-cell researcher who was arrested when he landed in the United States, in October, 2018, en route to a [visiting-scholar position](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/iran-releases-american-scholar-held-since-2016-in-prisoner-exchange/2019/12/07/7828a006-1846-11ea-9110-3b34ce1d92b1_story.html) at the Mayo Clinic. He had been [charged](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01901-4) with trying to export proteins used to culture cells for medical research without a U.S. license, a minor form of sanctions-busting.\n\nBoth men had been caught up in the decades of tension—played out in human lives—between Washington and Tehran. Both were widely seen as pawns. A senior Trump Administration official told reporters that he hoped Wang’s release was “a sign that the Iranians are realizing that their practice of hostage-taking diplomacy really should come to an end.” Six other Americans are [still detained](https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2019/oct/31/detainees-iran-and-us) in the Islamic Republic, including Robert Levinson, who disappeared inside the country twelve years ago. The Trump Administration has arrested at least thirteen Iranians in the U.S. in just the past two years. \n\nTrump took credit for the release, with thanks to the Swiss government, which has represented U.S. interests with Iran ever since Washington [severed ties](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/04/07/world/middleeast/iran-timeline.html) with Tehran, in 1980. Yet other interlocutors claim that the Administration usurped the narrative after almost three years of lethargic diplomacy. They claim that they initiated the negotiations and did much of the legwork—often despite resistance and roadblocks imposed by Trump’s current and former envoys, according to U.S. and Iranian sources.\n\nIn Zurich, Wang was turned over to Brian Hook, the U.S. Special Representative for Iran. The State Department tweeted a picture of the two on the tarmac in front of a blue-and-white Air Force plane. But Hook had been among those most resistant to dealing with Iran, according to multiple sources close to the negotiations. He has engaged only in recent weeks, after a swap appeared likely to happen with or without him, sources told me. Two days before the swap, Hook called on “all nations to stand with the Iranian people” and “diplomatically isolate the regime.” A leading hawk on Iran, Hook has also recently been [under investigation](https://www.stateoig.gov/system/files/esp-20-01-public.pdf) by the State Department’s inspector general for [discrimination](https://www.vox.com/2019/11/14/20953346/brian-hook-iran-inspector-general-sahar-nowrouzaddeh) against an Iranian-American employee.\n\nWinning the release of Americans imprisoned abroad is among the toughest and messiest challenges that the United States faces. It usually involves myriad players and interests, often outside the U.S. government—as was the case in the latest swap with Iran. Frustrated that the Administration was getting nowhere, Jason Poblete, the lawyer for the Wang family, said that he had reached out to the former Kansas congressman Jim Slattery. For years, Slattery had engaged with Iranians in a multidenominational Abrahamic dialogue; he had also travelled to Iran and knew the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, and Iran’s U.N. Ambassador, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who graduated from the University of Kansas. “Slattery and I were exploring many possible options to help Mr. Wang, including humanitarian pathways that should always be open, especially when relations between nations are difficult. These pathways can be useful for securing the release of Americans,” Poblete told me. They worked behind the scenes for several months with U.S. and Iranian parties and family members. “It was extremely complicated,” Poblete said. “We took our work to the Administration. It found a way to make it happen.” \n\nThe former U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson said that he also invested twenty months in negotiating with Iran behind the scenes. “I dispute the Administration’s version, because we negotiated the deal,” Richardson told me this weekend. He met with senior U.S. officials—from the White House, State Department, and Justice Department—and Iranian diplomats and Soleimani’s defense lawyers. A former congressman, governor, and Cabinet secretary, Richardson has [negotiated](https://www.richardsondiplomacy.org/negotiating-prisoner-and-hostage-releases/) prisoner cases with North Korea, Sudan, Colombia, Cuba, Iraq, Bolivia, Peru, and Bangladesh.\n\nThe turning point came in April, when Zarif publicly [signalled](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/trumps-strange-tense-campaign-against-iran) interest in a swap. “Exchange them. All these people that are in prison inside the United States, on an extradition request from the United States—we believe their charges are phony,” he said during a speech at the Asia Society, in New York. “The United States believes charges against these people in Iran are phony. Fine, let’s not discuss that. Let’s have an exchange. I’m ready to do it. And I have the authority to do it.”\n\nRichardson worked with Zarif on details when they met, in September, on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, he said. Slattery was part of that channel, too. As the first step in the process, they settled on the exchange of Wang and Soleimani. The first breakthrough coincided with a change within the Trump Administration following the [departure](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/us/politics/john-bolton-national-security-adviser-trump.html) of John Bolton, another hawk on Iran, from the National Security Council, in September. He was replaced by Robert O’Brien, the former State Department hostage negotiator. Among hostage families, O’Brien has been credited with generating more interest at the White House since he took over at the N.S.C. Richardson worked closely with O’Brien, he told me.\n\nRichardson, Slattery, and Poblete expected the exchange to unfold next week. In a plea deal that Slattery worked on with Soleimani’s lawyers, the Iranian scientist was due in an Atlanta court on December 11th, when he was expected to plead guilty, be sentenced to time served, and then be deported within days. After the judge’s ruling, Iran would release Wang to the Swiss Embassy in Tehran; the Swiss would then put him on a plane to Qatar. Richardson met with the Iranian U.N. Ambassador on December 4th to confirm the final details.\n\nOne of the trickiest aspects of the exchange was Soleimani’s legal status. The Justice Department wanted to follow through with his case but not appear to be subverting the U.S. judicial system in order to free an Iranian who had broken a law in exchange for an American wrongly jailed by Iran. The exchange negotiated by Richardson, Slattery, and Poblete was delayed while the Department of Justice “did due diligence,” Richardson said. The Justice Department did not want to be engaged in a prisoner swap that would set a dangerous precedent for the remaining hostages—and the future. The plea deal was the way around it. \n\nIn a surprise move, however, the Justice Department instead dropped all charges against Soleimani, the Administration official said on Saturday. He did not provide details. “We feel that, given where Mr. Soleimani’s case was headed, the fact that we were able to use Iran’s interests in having him come home to spur the negotiations that led to the return of Mr. Wang—we view that as a very, very good deal for the United States,” he said. The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. Slattery said that top White House officials abruptly approved the dropping of all charges against Soleimani. “Just within the last three days, there were directions from the highest levels of our government to blow by the plea deal and drop all charges,” he said. \n\nEven Soleimani’s lawyer, Lenny Franco, does not know why the charges were dropped. “If you can figure it out, let me know,” he told me on Sunday. He received a “frantic” call on Thursday morning from his office, informing him that the U.S. Attorney’s office in Atlanta had said a prisoner exchange was in the works. The judge agreed to dismiss charges without prejudice, but the decision would not go into effect until U.S. marshals delivered Soleimani to Zurich for the swap on Saturday. “Whenever you get charges dismissed as a defense attorney, you don’t ask why,” Franco told me. But, in forty-three years practicing law, he added, he’d never had a case that ended like this one. \n\nRichardson, Slattery, and Poblete all said that the Administration did not inform them of the exchange—or of the change in the plans that they had negotiated. Richardson and Slattery found out only when the news broke on Saturday, and Poblete by accident. “It wouldn’t cost much for them to acknowledge that this was done with our help,” Mickey Bergman, the vice-president of the Richardson Center for Global Engagement, told me. “They had insisted that we were delusional and wanted to call it off because they didn’t believe us.” Richardson added, “Typically, the Trump Administration does not like to share credit, but this is a happy outcome, so we shouldn’t fight over getting credit.”\n\nThe White House dismissed Richardson’s initiative. “While we appreciate Ambassador Richardson’s efforts, this release was negotiated by current U.S. officials with Swiss assistance,” a senior U.S. official told me. The Administration also rejected Zarif’s overture as propaganda. “We never believed that those public comments of Mr. Zarif were very serious,” the Administration official told reporters. “The proper way to deal with these sorts of negotiations was through established diplomatic channels, either in talks directly with the United States or going through our protecting power, the Swiss,” he said. Zarif flew to Zurich to pick up Soleimani. He tweeted a picture of the two on his plane flying back to Tehran. \n\nOn Saturday afternoon, Trump called the exchange “a great thing for Iran.” He told reporters, “I think it was great to show that we can do something. It might have been a precursor as to what can be done.” The Administration official said he was hopeful that Wang’s release was a sign that Iran is “willing to come to the table” to negotiate other flash points, including its nuclear program, missile tests, and role in other Middle Eastern countries. Both the United States and Iran have sought engagement, even as their differences have deepened.\n\nAli Vaez, the director of the Iran project at the International Crisis Group, said that the exchange was a reason for optimism, although it is only one step in dealing with forty years of hostage dramas and tensions with Iran. “It’d be wrong to overestimate the possibilities that the exchange could create, but it’d also be wrong to underestimate its promise,” Vaez told me. “It constitutes a very positive step, because it’s the first time under the Trump Administration that Iran and the U.S. have agreed on anything.”\n\n*This piece has been updated to include comments by Lenny Franco.*","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8841e4c73c088d777c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Iran","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"iran"},{"id":"5c2e1cb2b75f002c8941e4c2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Hostages","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"hostages"},{"id":"5c2e1cd9e56e652c902746ef","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Prisons, Prisoners","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"prisons-prisoners"},{"id":"5c2e2057425c632c6cd7089f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"U.S. State Department","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"us-state-department"},{"id":"5c2e1d6f4a08312cd3aa6d26","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Diplomacy","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"diplomacy"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8a54e65be2f29d55eb2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Robin Wright has been a contributing writer to *The New Yorker* since\n1988.

It will instead be the tsunami of protests that swept across six continents and engulfed both liberal democracies and ruthless autocracies. Throughout the year, movements have emerged overnight, out of nowhere, unleashing public fury on a global scale—from Paris and La Paz to Prague and Port-au-Prince, Beirut to Bogota and Berlin, Catalonia to Cairo, and in Hong Kong, Harare, Santiago, Sydney, Seoul, Quito, Jakarta, Tehran, Algiers, Baghdad, Budapest, London, New Delhi, Manila, and even Moscow. Taken together, the protests reflect unprecedented political mobilization. The global consequences dwarf the turmoil of the Trump year and his rippling impact beyond America’s borders.\n\n \n\n“People in more countries are using people power than any time in recorded history. Nonviolent mass movements are the primary challenges to governments today,” Erica Chenoweth, a political scientist at Harvard, told me. “This represents a pronounced shift in the global landscape of dissent.”\n\n \n\nPopular protests have long been part of the human story in the modern era: the [Protestant upheaval](https://www.history.com/topics/reformation/reformation) (so named for its protests), in the sixteenth century; the French Revolution and the Boston Tea Party, in the eighteenth century; and the uprisings that brought down the Berlin Wall and the Soviet empire, in the twentieth, to name just a few. They have always come in waves. One of the most famous waves was in 1968, a year of social activism that included antiwar demonstrations in the United States, workers’ strikes in France, the Prague Spring’s challenge to communism in Eastern Europe, and student protests in Mexico, Brazil, Spain, Britain, Germany, Italy, Pakistan and Poland. “At a time when nations and cultures were still separate and very different&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there occurred a spontaneous combustion of rebellious spirits around the world,” Mark Kurlansky [writes](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/20/1968theyearofrevolt.features) in “[1968: The Year That Rocked the World](https://www.amazon.com/1968-Year-That-Rocked-World/dp/0345455827).” “There has never been a year like 1968, and it is unlikely there will ever be one again,” he predicts.\n\n \n\nUntil now. Civil resistance in 2019 [brought down leaders](https://www.usip.org/publications/2019/12/six-takeaways-next-decade-people-power)—some democratically elected, others dictators long in power—in Algeria, Bolivia, Iraq, Lebanon, and Sudan. Movements still threaten regimes in Ecuador, Egypt, Georgia, Haiti, Peru, Poland, Russia, and Zimbabwe. They forced governments—through peaceful means—to reverse course on controversial policies in China, Chile, and France, countries with starkly different political systems, economies, and cultures.\n\n \n\nThe difference today, Chenoweth said, is that in 1968 there was still a widespread belief that real power flowed from the barrel of a gun. “In our time, that belief is crumbling. There is a falling away from the consensus that you need armed struggle” to change political systems, and an increasing sense that violent protest leads to a disproportionate loss of life. “People are not picking up guns as they did in earlier eras. They’re instead looking to civil resistance to assert their claims and seek transformation,” she said. “It’s what binds the different movements of our time.”\n\n +++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5e08cf9c9c6eb10008058b40]||||||\n+++\n\n\nThe triggers have been as diverse as the movements they spawned. Many of the catalysts in 2019 were originally small, even unlikely, and the initial demands modest. In Sudan, the spark was the price of bread, in January; in [India,](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49933613) the price of onions, in October; in [Brazil](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/thousands-protest-brazil-bolsonaro-education-cuts-190814033301567.html), it was a cutback in funding for school textbooks, in August; in [Lebanon](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50293636), a tax on WhatsApp usage, in October; in [Chile](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/01/chiles-streets-are-fire-with-protests-how-did-percent-fare-hike-set-off-such-rage/), a hike in subway fares, in October; and in [Iran](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/could-irans-revolution-unravel-over-a-four-cent-price-hike), a four-cent increase on a litre of gas, in November. But virtually all protests worldwide quickly escalated, and began issuing ultimatums for their governments to embrace sweeping changes—or to move aside.\n\n \n\nThe numbers have been blinding and the energy and endurance of the protesters staggering. An estimated three [million](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190330-algeria-millions-protest-for-the-sixth-week-against-bouteflika/) Algerians—almost [ten per cent of the population](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/algeria-population/)—turned out in the country, in February, to demand an end to President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s [twenty-year rule](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47795108). He resigned in April. The demands of the protesters then grew to include the ouster of “[the system](https://iacenter.org/2019/12/18/algerians-say-the-system-has-a-new-president-but-hes-not-ours/),” which in Algeria includes high-level military officers, politicians, and well-connected or corrupt businesspeople. Algeria elected a new president this month, but protesters are still [on the streets](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-50782676), because the man elected, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, was a crony of Bouteflika’s.\n\n \n\nIn June, [millions of protesters](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-48656471) in tiny Hong Kong ([population 7.4 million](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/china-hong-kong-sar-population/)) [demanded](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49317695) that the government—and its backers in Beijing—withdraw a controversial plan that would allow residents to be extradited for trial in China. It was the biggest challenge to Asia’s behemoth ([population 1.4 billion](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/china-population/)) in three decades. In September, the Hong Kong protesters prevailed—and then daringly went on to demand universal suffrage and an investigation of police violence. In November, the pro-democracy camp of the protesters [swept](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-50753963) local elections in a record turnout. And the protests are now headed into their seventh month.\n\n “It’s simplistic to think of these movements simply as protests,” [Carne Ross](https://independentdiplomat.org/about-us/staff/carne-ross/), the author of “[The Leaderless Revolution: How Ordinary People Will Take Power and Change Politics in the 21st Century](https://www.amazon.com/Leaderless-Revolution-Ordinary-Politics-Century/dp/0452298946),” told me. When that kind of energy is mustered, he said, it’s difficult for governments to resist unless they use repression. \n\nPaolo Gerbaudo, a political sociologist at King’s College London and the author of “[The Mask and the Flag: Populism, Citizenism and Global Protest](https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/the-mask-and-the-flag/),” said the demonstrations may signal an even greater crisis in the future. “These protests are popular insurgencies. They reflect the failure of nation-states in the global era. They’re not a passing crisis that can be remedied through the regular levers of the state,” he said.“These movements may be the early symptoms of a new global crisis. They are like seismographs. They are like dials that announce things that are coming on the horizon.”\n\n \n\nVastly different protests have borne common slogans and symbols. Hong Kong protesters adopted a phrase from the late martial artist Bruce Lee’s admonition to “[Be formless, shapeless, like water](https://twitter.com/joshuawongcf/status/1163311889528418305),” in order to be impossible to suppress. The “Be Water” slogan was adopted in Catalonia and by student protesters in Chile, whose initial tactic was to jump subway turnstiles to protest fare prices. Since the unrest erupted in France, the term “yellow vest”—apparel used in emergencies or associated with working-class industries—has become synonymous with public demonstrations. Diverse protests have also adopted common tactics—organizing with social-media technology and wearing masks to hide identities—that have complicated the ability of governments to contain them. Together, the protests of 2019 have produced an emerging global political culture.\n\n \n\nProtest movements will almost certainly be a feature of 2020 as well. “Protests are becoming part of ordinary political engagement,” [Richard Youngs](https://carnegieeurope.eu/experts/828), a democracy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the author of “[Civic Activism Unleashed: New Hope or False Dawn for Democracy?](https://www.amazon.com/Civic-Activism-Unleashed-Democracy-Endowment/dp/0190931701),” told me. “The range of protests is quite staggering if you think about what’s happening across Latin America, in several African countries, in Eastern Europe, in both poor and wealthy Asian nations and even in the most difficult of circumstances in Russia. It’s remarkable. There’s not a political model that seems to be doing well or that is inoculated from the kind of uprisings the world is witnessing.”\n\n \n\nThe growing array of protests has coincided with a notable [decline](https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/voter-turnout-trends-around-the-world.pdf) in voter turnout around the world, despite an increase in the number of voters and the number of countries with elections, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance. For five decades, between the nineteen-forties and nineteen-eighties, the average global turnout was stable: at least seventy-six per cent. By 2015, it had dropped to sixty-six per cent. The data suggests less confidence that elections make much difference, and that citizens are instead voting with their feet, on the streets.\n\n  +++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5e08cf9c7b5a740008639be8]||||||\n+++\n\n“What ties Hong Kong and Lebanon and Iraq with what we’re seeing in Chile, Bolivia, and Ecuador is the notion that political establishments have seized too much power,” David Gordon, a former vice-chair of the National Intelligence Council, who now works at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told me. “There’s a common discontent and a common disillusionment and a common sense among protesters that they deserve more—and that the political establishment is to blame.”\n\n \n\nWhatever the original flash points or agendas of the individual protests, taken together, they speak to a broader need for a new social contract between citizens and state power that goes beyond traditional political reforms, economic adjustments, or shifts in who sits at the top, Youngs said. In 1989, another year notable for unrest in China, Eastern Europe, and southern Africa, protests were regionally centered. “Today there is something structural and global that transcends the geo-political factors that triggered unrest in Europe in 1989,” he said. Protesters are challenging the political order not only of the twenty-first century but of the modern era.\n\n \n\nThe protests of 2019 have also altered the tactics, tools, and structure of civil resistance. Many have been loose-knit and leaderless and have drawn in people who consider themselves to be neither political nor civil-society activists. “They all represent a crisis of agency—of people who feel unrepresented,” Ross said. “For that reason, philosophically, they tend to not be top-down movements. If people want their own voice, they’re not happy if someone stands up and says they represent you. ‘We represent ourselves’ is a common feature of these protests.”\n\n \n\nTechnology has accelerated the organization and efficiency of protesting in 2019. In 1968, when sit-ins swept my campus at the University of Michigan, plans for protests were spread on landline telephones, through leaflets, or by word of mouth. In 1989, protesters had the fax. In 2011, as uprisings swept the Middle East, protesters had cell phones and social media, notably Twitter and Facebook. By 2019, encrypted apps, such as Telegram, WhatsApp, and AirDrop, offered a more secure means of communicating, a degree of anonymity, and less need for a single leader to mobilize. “There may be a global contagion due to social media. Seeing protests in other places motivates people to be willing to go to the streets in their own countries,” Gordon said.\n\n \n\nTo be enduring, movements today need to succeed in four factors, Chenoweth said. They need large and diverse participation. They need to create cracks in their opponents’ pillars of support, whether in business, politics, or the military. They need to employ a diverse set of tactics, including strikes, boycotts, or other forms of noncoöperation with the state. And they need to maintain discipline when government pressure tries to control or repress them. Because many of the movements today are leaderless, they find it harder to maintain control or unity.\n\n \n\nStatistically, protests in the twentieth century that had at least a thousand people participating had a fifty per cent success rate—twice as high as violent campaigns, Chenoweth said. Between 2000 and 2010, between sixty and seventy per cent of nonviolent campaigns were successful. From 2010 to 2019, the success rate declined to thirty per cent—but they were still far more successful than campaigns using guns, which were successful only ten per cent of the time. “One of the ironies is that, even as their absolute success has declined, the relative success of nonviolent resistance has increased,” Chenoweth told me. “The rate of success used to be two to one over armed conflict. Now it’s three to one.”\n\n \n\nProtest movements have serious limits, however. “Movements are called movements because they are not static and therefore can’t last,” Gerbaudo said. “They tend to come in waves. They give voice to concerns that are not in the public sphere. Once they have fulfilled the function, they tend to disperse.” Leaderless movements are not designed to govern, but they often generate momentum among politicians who take up or exploit their causes. “The rise of Bernie Sanders as a candidate would have been unthinkable without Occupy Wall Street,” Gerbaudo said.\n\n \n\nYet popular movements may have staying power well into the next decade and even beyond, Ross said, because of three accelerating stresses on every society: starker signs of environmental degradation that will increasingly impact daily life, worsening economic conditions and inequality generated by greedy globalization, and more mass migrations. And they can overlap. “If Europe has faced such a powerful rise of the extreme right since 2015, over a few thousand Syrian refugees reaching its shore, how are societies going to handle millions of climate refugees who will knock on the door of the West?” Gerbaudo said.\n\n \n\nMany Americans, distracted by the antics of their President, have paid little attention to the turmoil beyond their borders. Ignoring them comes at a perilous cost. The protests of 2019 have been epochal, the fury real, and the underlying message profound for the future.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ecb81ab3335f580f370","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1ecb81ab3335f580f370","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Protesters","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"protesters"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Protesters","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"protesters"},{"id":"5c2e1c87ee7fe02cbd16334a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c87ee7fe02cbd16334a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Activism","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"activism"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Activism","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"activism"},{"id":"5c2e1d3522d4972cd5b83328","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1d3522d4972cd5b83328","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Lebanon","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"lebanon"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Lebanon","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"lebanon"},{"id":"5c2e1dca41e4c73c088d78cb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1dca41e4c73c088d78cb","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Hong

[Wednesday’s impeachment hearing](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-impeachment-hearings-and-the-coming-storm), about the way it once again showcased the two non-overlapping realities into which American politics has split. But then I caught up on another hearing that took place on Wednesday, this one in a Moscow court. A twenty-one-year-old university student named Yegor Zhukov stood accused of “extremism,” for posting [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNxYQ1d7KHA) in which he talked about nonviolent protest, his campaign for a seat on the Moscow City Council, and different approaches to political power. In his most recent video, recorded four months ago, he suggested that “madmen” like [Vladimir Putin](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/vladimir-putin) view power as an end in itself, while political activists view it as an instrument of common action. In many of his vlog entries, Zhukov is seated against the backdrop of the Gadsden flag—“Don’t Tread on Me”—which appears to hang in his bedroom in his parents’ apartment. The prosecutor had asked for four years of prison time for Zhukov. On Friday, a Moscow court sentenced Zhukov to three years’ probation—an unusually light punishment probably explained by the public response to Zhukov’s speech, which several Russian media outlets dared to publish. Hundreds of people gathered in front of the courthouse on the day of the sentencing. As a condition of his probation, Zhukov is banned from posting to the Internet. The judge also ordered that the flag, which was confiscated by police, be destroyed.\n\nInstead of writing my own column, I have translated Zhukov’s final statement, delivered in court on Wednesday. I did it because it is a beautiful text that makes for instructive reading. Parts of it seem to describe American reality as accurately as the Russian one. Parts of it show what resistance can be. All of it, I hope, will make readers think twice before [they use the word “Russians” to mean goons](https://twitter.com/kadhimshubber/status/1201678997597364224). I also hope it will serve as a reminder of what we miss while we are—rightly—obsessed with American politics, which is made more provincial every day by its isolationist President and the need to try to reduce the harm he causes. As for the column I was going to write, I will still have plenty of opportunities to write it, while the very young man who spoke the following words will be unable to publish for the next three years.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n“This court hearing is concerned primarily with words and their meaning. We have discussed specific sentences, the subtleties of phrasing, different possible interpretations, and I hope that we have succeeded at showing to the honorable court that I am not an extremist, either from the point of view of linguistics or from the point of view of common sense. But now I would like to talk about a few things that are more basic than the meaning of words. I would like to talk about why I did the things I did, especially since the court expert offered his opinion on this. I would like to talk about my deep and true motives. The things that have motivated me to take up politics. The reasons why, among other things, I recorded videos for my blog.\n\n“But first I want to say this. The Russian state claims to be the world’s last protector of traditional values. We are told that the state devotes a lot of resources to protecting the institution of the family, and to patriotism. We are also told that the most important traditional value is the Christian faith. Your Honor, I think this may actually be a good thing. The Christian ethic includes two values that I consider central for myself. First, responsibility. Christianity is based on the story of a person who dared to take up the burden of the world. It’s the story of a person who accepted responsibility in the greatest possible sense of that word. In essence, the central concept of the Christian religion is the concept of individual responsibility.\n\n“The second value is love. ‘Love your neighbor as yourself’ is the most important sentence of the Christian faith. Love is trust, empathy, humanity, mutual aid, and care. A society built on such love is a strong society—probably the strongest of all possible societies.\n\n“To understand why I’ve done what I’ve done, all you have to do is look at how the Russian state, which proudly claims to be a defender of these values, does in reality. Before we talk about responsibility, we have to consider what the ethics of a responsible person are. What are the words that a responsible individual repeats to himself throughout his life? I think these words are ‘Remember that your path will be difficult, at times unbearably so. All your loved ones will die. All your plans will go awry. You will be betrayed and abandoned. And you cannot escape death. Life is suffering. Accept it. But once you accept it, once you accept the inevitability of suffering, you must still accept your cross and follow your dream, because otherwise things will only get worse. Be an example, be someone on whom others can depend. Do not obey despots, fight for the freedom of body and soul, and build a country in which your children can be happy.’\n\n“Is this really what we are taught? Is this really the ethics that children absorb at school? Are these the kinds of heroes we honor? No. Our society, as currently constituted, suppresses any possibility of human development. \\[Fewer than\\] ten per cent of Russians possess ninety per cent of the country’s wealth. Some of these wealthy individuals are, of course, perfectly decent citizens, but most of this wealth is accumulated not through honest labor that benefits humanity but, plainly, through corruption.\n\n“An impenetrable barrier divides our society in two. All the money is concentrated at the top and no one up there is going to let it go. All that’s left at the bottom—and this is no exaggeration—is despair. Knowing that they have nothing to hope for, that, no matter how hard they try, they cannot bring happiness to themselves or their families, Russian men take their aggression out on their wives, or drink themselves to death, or hang themselves. Russia has the world’s [second] highest rate of suicide among men. As a result, a third of all Russian families are single mothers with their kids. I would like to know: Is this how we are protecting the institution of the family?\n\n“Miron Fyodorov \\[a [rap artist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLx2boiXAvY) who [performs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFKhLYqUA0Q) under the name Oxxxymiron\\], who attended many of my court hearings, has observed that alcohol is cheaper than a textbook in Russian. The state is pushing Russians to make a choice between responsibility and irresponsibility, in favor of the latter.\n\n“Now I’d like to talk about love. Love is impossible in the absence of trust. Real trust is formed of common action. Common action is a rarity in a country where few people feel responsible. And where common action does occur, the guardians of the state immediately see it as a threat. It doesn’t matter what you do—whether you are helping prison inmates, speaking up for human rights, fighting for the environment—sooner or later you’ll either be branded a ‘foreign agent’ or just locked up. The state’s message is clear: ‘Go back to your burrow and don’t take part in common action. If we see more than two people together in the street, we’ll jail you for protesting. If you work together on social issues, we’ll assign you the status of a “foreign agent.”&nbsp;’ Where can trust come from in a country like this—and where can love grow? I’m speaking not of romantic love but of the love of humanity.\n\n“The only social policy the Russian state pursues consistently is the policy of atomization. The state dehumanizes us in one another’s eyes. In the state’s own eyes, we stopped being human a long time ago. Otherwise, why would it treat its citizens the way it does? Why does it punctuate its treatment of people through daily nightstick beatings, prison torture, inaction in the face of an H.I.V. epidemic, the closure of schools and hospitals, and so on?\n\n“Let’s look at ourselves in the mirror. We let this be done to us, and who have we become? We have become a nation that has unlearned responsibility. We have become a nation that has unlearned love. More than two hundred years ago, Alexander Radishchev \\[widely regarded as the first Russian political writer\\], as he travelled from St. Petersburg to Moscow, wrote, ‘I gazed around myself, and my soul was wounded by human suffering. I then looked inside myself, and saw that man’s troubles come from man himself.’ Where are these kinds of people today? Where are the people whose hearts ache this much for what is happening in our country? Why are hardly any people like this left?\n\n“It turns out that the only traditional institution that the Russian state truly respects and protects is the institution of autocracy. Autocracy aims to destroy anyone who actually wants to work for the benefit of the homeland, who isn’t scared to love and take on responsibility. As a result, our long-suffering citizens have had to learn that initiative will be punished, that the boss is always right just because he is the boss, that happiness may be within reach—but not for them. And having learned this, they gradually started to disappear. According to the state statistical authority, Russians are slowly vanishing, at the rate of four hundred thousand people a year. [Deaths exceeded births by nearly two hundred thousand in the first six months of 2019.\\] You can’t see the people behind the statistics. But try to see them! These are the people who are drinking themselves to death from helplessness, the people freezing to death in unheated hospitals, the people murdered by others, and those who kill themselves. These are people. People like you and me.\n\n“By this point, it’s probably clear why I did what I did. I really want to see these two qualities—responsibility and love—in my fellow-citizens. Responsibility for one’s self, for one’s neighbors, for one’s country. This wish of mine, Your Honor, is another reason why I could not have called for violence. Violence breeds impunity, which breeds irresponsibility. By the same token, violence does not bear love. Still, despite all obstacles, I have no doubt that my wish will come true. I am looking ahead, beyond the horizon of years, and I see a Russia full of responsible, loving people. It will be a truly happy place. I want everyone to imagine Russia like this. And I hope this image can lead you in your work, as it has led me in mine.\n\n“In conclusion, I would like to state that if the court decides that these words are spoken by a truly dangerous criminal, the next few years of my life will be marked by deprivation and adversity. But I look at the people [who have been jailed in the latest wave of activist arrests] and I see smiles on their faces. Two people I met briefly during pretrial detention, Lyosha Minyaylo and Danya Konon, never complained. I will try to follow their example. I will endeavor to take joy in having this chance—the chance to be tested in the name of values I hold dear. In the end, Your Honor, the more frightening my future, the broader the smile with which I look at it. Thank you.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c777e716b454591ad9f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Russia","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"russia"},{"id":"5c2e1c8dee7fe02cbd163357","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Vladimir Putin","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"vladimir-putin"},{"id":"5c2e1d9b36cecf401921431a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Political Prisoners","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"political-prisoners"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a6e62e2e17730741c6b7","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Masha Gessen began contributing to *The New Yorker* in 2014 and became a staff writer in 2017\\.

By standards anywhere else in the world, it is still pitifully cheap. A litre of gas increased from [eight cents to twelve cents](https://apnews.com/7a4dec6db2ab451bbb6c6cab4b524a79)—or to fifty cents per gallon—for the first fifteen gallons each month. That’s about a [tankful](https://www.quickenloans.com/blog/cost-fill) for a large car. After that, gas went up to ninety cents per gallon. (The U.S. average is around two dollars and sixty cents per gallon.) The price hike nevertheless triggered instant outrage. During the next four days, protests erupted in a [hundred cities](https://iranprimer.usip.org/index.php/blog/2019/dec/05/state-department-protest-crackdown-intervention-yemen) across the country. The theocracy responded with ruthless brutality. Hundreds, at least, were killed.\n\n \n\n“As the truth is trickling out of Iran, it appears the regime could have murdered over a thousand Iranian citizens since the protests began,” Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative for Iran, said at a State Department briefing about the unrest, on Thursday. At least seven thousand were detained, and “many thousands” were wounded, he said. To curtail the protests and contain reports about it, Iran cut off access to the Internet. After access was restored, the State Department set up a [tip line](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/05/us-envoy-iran-protesters-killed-076378) on Telegram, for Iranians to submit video, photos, and other evidence of the government crackdown. Hook said that it received more than thirty-two thousand responses.\n\n \n\nThe protests represented the widest unrest since the 2009 Green Movement uprising over alleged fraud in a Presidential election. They were the [deadliest](https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2019/dec/05/fact-sheet-protests-iran-1999-2019-0) since the [1979 revolution](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/iran-celebrates-the-revolutions-fortieth-anniversarytwelve-blocks-from-the-white-house), which ousted the last dynasty. By the government’s own [count](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-gasoline-protests-minister/iran-says-hundreds-of-banks-were-torched-in-vast-unrest-plot-idUSKBN1Y10GY), protesters torched more than seven hundred and thirty banks, destroyed a hundred and forty government sites, and attacked fifty police-force bases.\n\n \n\nThe protests quickly escalated from being about the price of gasoline to being about the future of the theocracy. “Have shame, dictator—leave the country alone!” protesters [shouted](https://en.radiofarda.com/a/protests-over-fuel-prices-in-iran-spread-to-multiple-cities/30274440.html) in Mashhad, Iran’s holy city, normally a bastion of conservative support for the Islamic Republic. The term “dictator” refers to [Ayatollah Ali Khamenei](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/trump-sanctions-irans-supreme-leader-but-to-what-end), Iran’s Supreme Leader for the past three decades. In the oil-rich Khuzestan Province, demonstrators chanted against President Hassan Rouhani: “Have shame, Rouhani—leave the country alone!”\n\n \n\n“The November unrest is at least as serious a threat to the longevity of the Islamic Republic as the post-election upheaval in 2009 was at that time and arguably more challenging to overcome or durably repair,” Suzanne Maloney, the deputy director of the foreign-policy program at the Brookings Institution, told me. “Back then, the main schism was within the political establishment and secondarily within the politically engaged middle class.” A decade later, she said, “the fissures run deeper into the core constituency of the regime, and the disaffection is more systemic and more intense.” The internal tensions, including the government’s brutal response, “are indicative of a system whose resilience is dangerously fraying,” she said. She compared it to “a slow-motion metastasis that is echoing across the political establishment, the economy, and society.”\n\n \n\nUtopian ideologies and revolutionary regimes are often undone by a confluence of political and economic factors, which is exactly what is happening in Iran. The political unrest intersected with chronic economic challenges produced by the [Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) Administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign, combined with regime mismanagement and corruption. The United States reimposed sweeping economic sanctions a year ago, a few months after walking away from the historic nuclear deal that was brokered between Iran and the world’s six major powers, in 2015\\. Sanctions have cut off Iran’s ability to export oil, its primary source of revenue. In 2016, it exported 3\\.2 million barrels of oil per day; this fall, it’s been down to about three hundred thousand barrels of oil. The value of Iran’s rial has also plummeted, slashing consumer buying power for daily goods and raising the price of all imports. In 2015, the rial traded at just over thirty thousand rials to the dollar. Today, it trades at almost a hundred and thirty thousand rials to the dollar. Although the rial had stabilized, food inflation was, until recently, between sixty per cent and seventy per cent during a twelve-month period, Adnan Mazarei, an Iran specialist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and the former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s Middle East Department, told me. In October, the I.M.F. [downgraded](https://www.france24.com/en/20191015-imf-sharply-cuts-iran-saudi-growth-forecasts) its economic forecast for Iran. Its economy is expected to contract by 9\\.5 per cent this year—its worst performance in thirty-five years, since the nineteen-eighties, when the country faced challenges during eight years of war with Iraq.\n\n \n\nThe price hike was actually a smart move economically, according to the I.M.F. Iran has long provided subsidies for basic commodities that it cannot afford because its population has mushroomed from just over thirty million at the time of the revolution, forty years ago, to more than eighty million today. The plan was designed to help the poor. It cut subsidies that also helped the rich consume even more; it included doling out millions in cash to the lower classes to compensate for the price hike. “Under the current circumstances that the country is facing the most unprecedented sanctions and pressures, the main reason for adjusting prices is to promote social justice or to move toward that [goal],” Ali Rabiei, the government spokesman, [told](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-gasoline-protests-arrests/irans-revolutionary-guards-arrest-about-100-protest-leaders-iranian-judiciary-idUSKBN1XW1W0) a local news agency. The mistake was failing to provide advance warning or details, Mazarei said.  \n\nIran’s Supreme Leader [blamed](https://www.foxnews.com/world/irans-khamenei-protests-us-backed-conspiracy) the United States and Israel for fomenting the unrest and local thugs for exploiting it. Security forces put down “a very dangerous, deep conspiracy that cost so much money and effort,” Khamenei said in comments to the Basij, a paramilitary force under the Revolutionary Guard. “In such incidents, hooligans, spiteful and evil people, often enter the field and, sometimes, some youths, driven by emotion, accompany them and commit seditious acts. Such deeds do not fix anything other than adding insecurity to the problems.” Iran’s Revolutionary Guard—the élite force created to preserve the revolution—has vowed to quash any future unrest. “If necessary we will take decisive and revolutionary action against any continued moves to disturb the people’s peace and security,” it [said](https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2019/nov/18/protests-overview), in a statement.\n\n \n\nFor now, the Islamic Republic may be able to contain the unrest. “The violence is not necessarily a precursor to more massive political violence in Iran; nor is it the desperate and bloody response of a regime verging on collapse,” Elizabeth Rosenberg, a former treasury specialist now at the Center for a New American Security, told me. Despite Iran’s struggles under powerful sanctions, “it would be folly to underestimate the staying power of Iran’s regime élites who are experts at repressive rule and economic resilience in conditions of extreme hardship,” she said. “We should not expect a fatal turning point for the revolution any time soon.”\n\n \n\nThe November protests are the [fourth major challenge](https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2019/dec/05/fact-sheet-protests-iran-1999-2019-0) to the revolution. In July, 1999, students protested for five days against the closure of a reformist newspaper; it was put down by force when security forces raided dormitories and campuses. In 2009, millions rose up across the country to protest voter fraud in the reëlection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The demonstrations ran on sporadically for more than eight months. Thousands were arrested, including former government officials and members of parliament who backed the protests. Two of the opposition’s Presidential candidates—former Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi and former Parliamentary Speaker Mehdi Karroubi—are still under house arrest. In late 2017 and early 2018, protests lasted for weeks in thirty of Iran’s thirty-one provinces over economic issues, including unemployment and unpaid wages.\n\n \n\nThe question now is how much support the revolution has lost with each round. “The Iranian regime keeps losing major constituencies in its revolutionary base: first the students, then the middle class and merchants, then the working class, and even many of the clergy who criticize the regime,” Hook, the State Department envoy, said. “Now, in the latest protests, nine seminaries were burned. The only support left for the regime is with a handful of clerics whom the Iranian people despise for having imposed forty years of brutality on them.”\n\n \n\nOne of the striking aspects of the two most recent rounds of protests, in 2017 and this year, is that they were largely spontaneous with no known national leadership, Marazei noted. They were decentralized. In the latest unrest, the protesters also played into local grievances, such as discontent among the Arab minority in Khuzestan Province. The State Department said that it received a video showing troops from the Revolutionary Guard mowing down protesters in Mahshahr, a city in southwest Khuzestan. When protesters fled to the nearby marshlands, troops surrounded them in trucks mounted with machine guns. Screams of the victims could be heard on the video. In that one incident, the regime murdered several hundred. “When it was over, the regime loaded the bodies into trucks,” Hook said. “We do not yet know where these bodies went, but we are learning more and more about how the Iranian regime treats its own people.”\n\n \n\nPressures on the regime are certain to grow, with the United States promising to further tighten the economic squeeze until Iran returns to the negotiating table. “An amorphous, unpredictable movement that is fiercely estranged from the Islamic Republic represents an acute vulnerability for Tehran, especially at a time when key political transitions, like succession, loom large,” Maloney said. Iran faces parliamentary elections in February and a Presidential election in 2021; Rouhani is now a lame duck. The more important transition will come when the Supreme Leader, who turned eighty this summer, dies. His replacement will set the tenor for Iranian politics, security, and the economy for the future. “The regime can maintain and even intensify its violent repression of protestors. But the system’s legitimacy rests on some foundational claim to popular support,” Maloney said. “Routine reliance on fierce crackdowns, applied across the country, will further erode the coherence of the system and compound the challenges facing the current leadership.”\n\n \n\nIn other words, that four-cent price hike proved disproportionately costly to the regime and also its people, making the political environment more unstable and the theocracy’s future more uncertain.\n\n \n\n \n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8841e4c73c088d777c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Iran","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"iran"},{"id":"5c2e21602710c62d1081575d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Gas","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"gas"},{"id":"5c2e1e3ae56e652c9027486e","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Revolution","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"revolution"},{"id":"5c2e2107e56e652c902749ec","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ali Khamenei","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ali-khamenei"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8a54e65be2f29d55eb2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Robin Wright has been a contributing writer to *The New Yorker* since\n1988.

But the lengthy impeachment debate in the House of Representatives on Wednesday showed that he has taught Republican members of Congress to repeat his propaganda so faithfully it would be beyond even the most able little parasite. Either that or the Republicans taught themselves, which is an even more alarming thought.\n\nThe President “was denied due process.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That makes this process illegal and illegitimate. What a shame. What a sham.” This was the Republican Blaine Luetkemeyer, who represents Missouri’s Third Congressional District. “The process has been rigged from the start,” Debbie Lesko, a first-term Republican congresswoman from Arizona, said. “I am voting no because the President has done nothing wrong,” Roger Marshall, an obstetrician who represents a sprawling Republican district in northwest Kansas, declared. “The only party guilty of obstruction, abuse of power, or whatever focus-groups terms they’re using today is the party on the other side.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It’s past time to be done with this circus.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I will vote no and encourage this body to move on from this heartbreaking, disgraceful day.”\n\nThe contributions from Luetkemeyer, Lesko, and Marshall were notable not because they were unusual or novel but because they were entirely typical. One after another, all day long, the Republicans parroted the lines that Trump has been feeding them since September, when the news broke that an anonymous whistle-blower had filed a complaint about Trump’s behavior, and the Ukraine story was blown open.\n\nAs the sorry details emerged of how Trump squeezed [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/11/04/how-trumps-emissaries-put-pressure-on-ukraines-new-president), the President of Ukraine, to dig up dirt on the Biden family—or, at least, to announce that he was starting an investigation into the Bidens—some commentators, myself included, speculated that the Republicans would ultimately fall back on the argument that Trump’s actions, although reprehensible, didn’t rise to the level required for impeachment. And indeed, [Jonathan Turley](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-law-professors-brought-to-the-trump-impeachment-hearings), a George Washington University Law School professor, did make a version of this argument earlier this month, when the House Republicans invited him to testify to the Judiciary Committee.\n\nThat defense wasn’t good enough for Trump: not nearly. From the very beginning, he has insisted that his July 25th call with Zelensky was “perfect”; that he had merely been pressing the Ukrainian President to tackle domestic corruption in Ukraine, even though he never used that word; and that the entire impeachment inquiry was a Democratic “witch hunt.” But Trump didn’t merely promulgate this fake narrative himself. He demanded that Republicans in Congress repeat it, too, and Wednesday’s hearing showed how completely he succeeded in bending the House G.O.P. caucus to his will.\n\nBy the eve of the hearing, it was clear that not a single Republican would vote for the two articles of impeachment. It still seemed conceivable, at least, that one or two of them would allow that Trump’s behavior had raised some serious concerns. No. Congressman Will Hurd, the sole black Republican in the House, who recently announced his plans to retire, perhaps came closest when he said that the impeachment inquiry had unearthed “bungling foreign-policy decisions.” In truth, however, even that statement was a woeful cop-out.\n\nThe rest of the Republicans acted as if they were participating in a show trial—one with a  predetermined not-guilty verdict. James Comer, of Kentucky, described the impeachment process as “a baseless attempt” to override the votes of sixty-three million Americans. Denver Riggleman, a Virginia congressman whose district includes Monticello, said that Jefferson and Madison would hate to see Congress trying to reverse the result of an election. Greg Murphy, from North Carolina, declared the proceeding to be “a mockery of American justice.” Clay Higgins, a hard-right pro-Trumper from Louisiana, called impeachment “a betrayal” and said it was “brought upon us by the same socialists who threaten unborn life in the womb.”\n\nTrump, who the White House press office claimed might “catch some of the proceedings”—even as he tweeted about it (in all caps)—will have appreciated Higgins’s rant. But the prize for the most ludicrous speech on his behalf perhaps went to Representative Barry Loudermilk, of Georgia, who reached into the New Testament for inspiration. “When Jesus was falsely accused of treason, Pontius Pilate gave Jesus the opportunity to face his accusers,” Loudermilk declared. “During that sham trial, Pontius Pilate afforded more rights to Jesus than the Democrats have afforded this President in this process.”\n\nAfter Loudermilk finished, Jerry Nadler, the chair of the Judiciary Committee, which drew up the articles of impeachment, calmly pointed out that the committee afforded Trump the chance to personally testify, as well as to have a counsel present who could question other witnesses. The President turned down these offers. Adam Schiff, the head of the Intelligence Committee, quoted Hamilton, one of the originators of the impeachment clause, and said he “predicted the rise of Donald Trump with staggering prescience.” John Lewis, the seventeen-term Democratic congressman from Georgia, invoked generations to come and said, “We have a mission and a mandate to be on the right side of history.”\n\nThese were memorable moments, but not as memorable as the abject submission to Trump and Trumpery that the elected Republicans displayed throughout. When historians look back on this day, that is surely what they will find most notable, and tragic.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c7b36cecf40192141d2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7b36cecf40192141d2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Republicans","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"republicans"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Republicans","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"republicans"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"},{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"},{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"}],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[{"id":"5904126172dadf5d0a508800","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81ab371770228fe7e770","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Channels","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"channels"},"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

on the second day of the House Judiciary Committee’s hearing about the Democrats’ articles of impeachment against [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump), Republicans on the committee would have presented a detailed and painstakingly constructed argument to show why the evidence doesn’t support the charges against the President.  But, in actuality, the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee spent much of their time talking about—you guessed it—Hunter Biden. \n\nDuring the morning session, the committee voted along party lines to reject a G.O.P. effort to strike the first article of impeachment, which accuses Trump of abusing his Presidential power by pressuring the President of Ukraine to dig up dirt on his domestic political rivals. After that, Representative Matt Gaetz, a Republican whose district is in the Florida Panhandle, introduced a separate amendment. This one would have struck the reference to Joe Biden in the first article of impeachment and replaced it with a reference to his son and to Burisma, the Ukrainian company that added Hunter to its board for a time.\n\nGaetz, a Trump überloyalist and an N.R.A. favorite who once introduced legislation to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency, began by rambling on about what Hunter Biden did or didn’t do for Burisma. Then he brought up the younger Biden’s history of drug problems, reading a passage from a [lengthy Profile of him](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/will-hunter-biden-jeopardize-his-fathers-campaign), by *The New Yorker’s* Adam Entous, which describes how on one occasion “a white powdery substance” was found in a rental car he had driven. “I don’t want to make light of anybody’s substance-abuse issues,” Gaetz said. “But it’s a little hard to believe that Burisma hired Hunter Biden to resolve their international disputes when he could not resolve his own dispute with Hertz rental cars over leaving cocaine and a crack pipe in the car.”\n\nEven by the base standards of today’s House G.O.P., which often resembles a ragtag protest group more than a government party, this was a slimy effort at diversion. “This is about distraction, distraction, distraction,” the veteran Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee, of Texas, accurately pointed out. But it was left to Hank Johnson, a seven-term Democratic congressman from Georgia, to deliver the most effective put-down of Gaetz. “The pot calling the kettle black is not something that we should do,” Johnson said. “I don’t know what members, if any, have had any problems with substance abuse, been busted in a D.U.I.—I don’t know. But, if I did, I wouldn’t raise it against anyone on this committee.” The titters that went around the hearing room as Johnson was speaking indicated that at least some of those present knew what he was referring to.\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\nLate one night in 2008, a police deputy stopped Gaetz’s car, for speeding, not far from the congressman’s home. In his incident report, the deputy said that Gaetz smelled of beer and that “his eyes were watery and bloodshot, and he swayed and staggered when he got out of the car.” The deputy arrested Gaetz and took him to a police station, where he was booked and photographed. For reasons that have never been entirely clear, the charges against Gaetz were later dropped. But, in an interview with the Tampa Bay *Times*, in 2014, Gaetz acknowledged that he had “made bad decisions that resulted in an arrest” and added, “That is sort of something that we all live with.”\n\nIf you think, for a moment, that Johnson’s rebuke was sufficient to shame Gaetz into silence, you haven’t been paying attention for the past few months. In their fealty to Trump, many members of the House G.O.P. are entirely shameless and more than a bit bonkers. Given a second opportunity to speak, Gaetz brought up Hillary Clinton—why not?—and said he was just glad that the country now had a President who is concerned about corruption.\n\n\nHe wasn’t the only Republican to speak in favor of his amendment, of course. Another was Louie Gohmert, the Texan who once issued a dire warning about “terror babies” and who, on Wednesday night, as the hearing started, read out the name of an official who has been identified, in some reports, as the intelligence whistle-blower. In weighing in on Gaetz’s amendment, Gohmert followed his example and brought up Clinton. He also offered a novel theory that she was somehow responsible for the Democrats’ impeachment of Trump. “What we continue to see is projection,” Gohmert said. “Someone on their side engages in illicit conduct and that is what they accuse President Trump of doing.”\n\nWithin the confines of a supposedly serious congressional hearing, there is no wholly effective way to counter the sort of slime and gibberish that Gaetz and Gohmert were promoting. In any case, it wasn’t directed at Americans who are undecided about the merits of impeaching Trump, if any such people exist. Its only purpose was to fire up the Trump faithful, go viral on right-wing Web sites, and, perhaps, even get picked up on Fox News. In other words, it was part of politics as a tribal ritual rather than politics as rational discourse, and, therefore, it was largely immune to rational counter-argument.\n\nSome of the Democrats on the committee tried their best, anyway, to remind people why Joe Biden’s name was the one included in the first article of impeachment. In doing so, these Democrats focussed on the actual acts at the center of the impeachment investigation—acts that most of the Republicans on the panel had assiduously avoided or deliberately downplayed.\n\nJackson Lee pointed out that Trump had put aid to Ukraine on hold despite the fact that the State Department and other U.S. agencies had stated that the country was already in compliance with anti-corruption directives. Hakeem Jeffries, the chair of the House Democratic Caucus, read out a list of the names of witnesses, Trump appointees all, who confirmed that the President had pressured a foreign government to target a U.S. citizen: Biden. Zoe Lofgren, who represents a district in Silicon Valley, said that, although the behavior of Hunter Biden and of Trump’s sons and daughters were things that voters could consider in a general election, “here we are talking about the abuse of Presidential authority.” \n\nThat final statement was a bit incomplete. In referring to “we,” Lofgren should have made clear that she wasn’t including the Republicans on the committee. If there was one thing they were determined not to talk about, it was Trump abusing his power or doing anything wrong.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5c2e25e441c92e2c9b85ddf6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"House Judiciary Committee","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"house-judiciary-committee"},{"id":"5c2e1c7b36cecf40192141d2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Republicans","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"republicans"},{"id":"5c2e1c9ae56e652c90274691","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Republican Party (G.O.P.)","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"republican-party-gop"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

But what did the result mean for the right? In an [essay](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-british-test-for-the-populist-revolution-11575647973) published shortly before the election, Gerard Baker, the *Wall Street Journal’s* editor-at-large, said that, if [Boris Johnson’s](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/boris-johnson) “new national populist party wins on Thursday, it will be a model that will be studied by ambitious conservatives across the West.” On Monday, Walter Russell Mead, a historian at Bard College, also writing in the *Journal*, [hailed](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lessons-from-the-tory-landslide-11576540523?mod=opinion_lead_pos9) Johnson’s effort to create “what we might call National Conservatism,” a “pro-enterprise political approach that is nevertheless grounded in the traditional sentiments and loyalties of the people.”\n\nBaker and Mead were both grappling with the fact that Johnson’s Conservative Party, which was long dominated by affluent residents of suburban and rural areas, now has a big working-class contingent. In the election, it picked up dozens of seats in the north of England that have voted Labour for decades. This development has been attributed to Johnson’s promise of a rapid [Brexit](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brexit) and the unpopularity of [Jeremy Corbyn](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jeremy-corbyn), the Labour leader. But it also represented the continuation of a deeper trend. Labour’s share of the working-class vote has been falling for decades. Last Thursday, according to a [survey](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/12/17/how-britain-voted-2019-general-election) of voters by the polling firm YouGov, only a third of the British working class—defined in terms of occupational categories—voted for Labour. The Conservatives’ share of the working-class vote, meanwhile, hit a new high of [forty-eight per cent](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-election-factbox/factbox-uk-election-conservative-gains-and-losses-idUSKBN1YH061). (The rest was split among other parties.)\n\nTo some extent, the result of the British election mimicked that of the 2016 U.S. election, when many white working-class Americans warmed to Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric, and also to his promises to reduce immigration and protect U.S. jobs—a program that [Steve Bannon](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/steve-bannon), his former campaign chief, has referred to as “economic nationalism.” In [an interview](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/17/steve-bannon-working-class-republicans-labour) with the *Guardian* that was published on Tuesday, Bannon hailed the British-election result, and, turning his attention closer to home, boasted, “We’ve turned the Republican party into a working-class party.”\n\nDespite the U.S. election result in 2016, that blanket statement was misleading: the G.O.P. still has the support of many affluent people, including religious conservatives, small-business owners, and conservative plutocrats. It would be equally misleading to refer to the Conservative Party as a working-class party. The reality is that it now represents an awkward coalition of traditional shire Tories, free-enterprise conservatives, and working-class voters. But, on both sides of the Atlantic, politics is in flux. Amid a continuing dealignment of traditional voting patterns, based on income and class, the major political parties are trying to put together new electoral coalitions and new messaging architectures. The terms “economic nationalism,” “National Conservatism,” and “national populist” represent right-wing entries in the messaging contest. But what do they really amount to? And do they provide a long-term basis for holding together the new Republican and Conservative coalitions? The answers aren’t yet clear.\n\nAfter Trump’s election, his economic nationalism turned out to encompass a feed-the-plutocrats tax cut, a still-to-be-constructed [border wall](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/border-wall), and a series of tariffs on Chinese goods which have failed to reverse decades of globalization and deindustrialization. In the past couple of years, the trade deficit with China has risen, while job growth in manufacturing and agriculture, two sectors particularly sensitive to trade, have stagnated. As an [article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/16/business/trump-midwest-swing-jobs.html) in the *Times* pointed out on Monday, employment growth has been particularly slow in some of the Midwestern states that are key to Trump’s reëlection strategy. Not entirely coincidentally, he has just called a truce in his trade war.\n\nIn my opinion, the President’s continuing popularity with Republican voters—working-class and non-working-class—has less to do with protectionism and economic nationalism than it does with the continued strength of the broader economy, his assiduous cultivation of social and racial resentments, and his unceasing depiction of himself as a foe and victim of the Washington establishment. In this sense, demagoguery and the cult of personality seem at least as important as economics.\n\nAlthough Johnson is often compared to Trump, he is more of a mainstream Conservative politician—albeit a very slippery one. In last week’s election, his appeal appears to have been largely transactional and situational: he promised to put an end to the Brexit paralysis, and he wasn’t Corbyn. Going forward, though, what sort of economic panacea can he offer the gritty northern towns that voted Conservative—places like Bishop Auckland, Blyth Valley, Burnley, Leigh, and Scunthorpe, all of which have suffered decades of deindustrialization?\n\nSome of Johnson’s allies hold up a [post-Brexit vision of the United Kingdom](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2019/08/12/boris-johnsons-real-agenda-the-singapore-scenario/) as a North Atlantic version of Singapore: an entrepreneurial trading powerhouse. With the country’s access to the vast European market about to be restricted, that is a fantasy. Far from moving into Britain, many multinational companies may well reconsider their existing investments there. (Some of them already are.) By ending freedom of movement into the United Kingdom from other countries in the the European Union, Brexit may well stem the inflow of Poles, Romanians, Bulgarians and other Europeans seeking work, which will please some of Johnson’s supporters. But, on its own, Brexit certainly won’t revive the struggling post-industrial towns that voted Conservative; it is far more likely to hurt them.\n\nSome observers are suggesting that, to counter the negative effects of Brexit and maintain the support of these towns, Johnson and the Conservatives will eventually abandon their commitment to a balanced budget, borrowing large sums to finance increases in government spending and instituting new tax cuts. Trump abandoned fiscal rectitude long ago, of course. (It’s not clear that he even knows what it means.) In fiscal year 2019, which ended in September, the budget deficit was almost a trillion dollars, and in October and November it [rose](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/12/11/business/ap-us-budget-deficit.html) even further on a monthly basis. \n\nIf Johnson went in this direction, he could conceivably fund substantial increases in spending on the National Health Service and other public programs and combine it with some get-tough policies on immigration and crime. (He’s already [proposed](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5dda924905da587992a064ba_Conservative%202019%20Manifesto.pdf) hiring more police, enabling stop-and-frisk, and introducing tougher custodial sentences for criminals.) This type of left-right combo might prove popular with many ex-Labour voters. However, it would amount to abandoning the identity of the Conservatives as the guardians of sound finance and the enemies of profligate spending. The Party’s election manifesto, far from hinting at such a shift, pledged that “debt will be lower at the end of the parliament—rather than spiraling out of control under Labour.”\n\nTo be sure, working-class conservatism (or conservative populism, or economic nationalism, or whatever you want to call it) is now a powerful force on both sides of the Atlantic. But in Britain it is still very much a work in progress, and in the United States it is closely connected to one man, and his appeal. How durable it proves to be remains to be seen. \n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274662","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Brexit","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"brexit"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e20a67e716b454591b096","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"British Elections","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"british-elections"},{"id":"5c2e20a42bc86f2c9a244ce7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Conservative","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"conservative"},{"id":"5c2e1c8a22d4972cd5b832ac","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Conservative Party","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"conservative-party"},{"id":"5c2e1c8a36cecf40192141ef","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Labour Party","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"labour-party"},{"id":"5c2e1c76ee7fe02cbd163322","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Conservatism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"conservatism"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

Republicans called the impeachment process “unfair,” “politically biased,” “rigged,” “madness,” and a “charade.” Democrats spoke of “duty,” “deterrence,” the “rule of law,” “our children,” the “abuse of power,” and the need to defend “democracy itself.”\n\nTheoretically, the stakes are highest for [President Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump), though there is little chance that two-thirds of the Senate will vote to remove him from office. Instead, in many ways, it is Pelosi who faces the highest political stakes. Last year, Pelosi took control of the House after a sweeping Democratic victory in the 2018 midterm elections. With a clear mandate to counter Trump, she launched a half-dozen investigations of the Administration and issued hundreds of subpoenas for witnesses and documents. When the Trump White House took the unprecedented step of flouting every House subpoena, she took it to court. Eventually, the Supreme Court will decide that battle. \n\nIn meetings in the Oval Office and the Cabinet room, Pelosi has appeared, to Democrats, to get the best of Trump, leading to memes depicting Pelosi as the calm parent lecturing Trump, the angry child. This week, Pelosi also achieved limited legislative victories. She renegotiated part of the U.S.–Mexico–Canada trade pact and helped avert a third government shutdown. Yet she clearly achieved more during her previous tenure as Speaker, from 2007 to 2011. First, her investigations of the final years of the George W. Bush Administration helped elect Barack Obama as President. Then Pelosi helped Obama enact landmark legislation, from the Affordable Care Act to the stimulus package to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reforms. \n\nWith Wednesday’s vote, Trump’s impeachment will become a central part of Pelosi’s legacy. From beginning to end, Pelosi has personally controlled the process. Her dominance reflects a recent change in how Congress functions, with Speakers and minority leaders centralizing power at the expense of once dominant committee chairs. Throwing out the Nixon and Clinton playbooks, she invented a new form of impeachment for the Trump era: a fast-paced and narrowly focussed investigation led by the Intelligence Committee. In the face of White House obstruction, she brought impeachment articles to the House floor rather than wait for a Supreme Court ruling. She has personally launched each stage of the probe and personally blamed Trump for the crisis. “He gave us no choice,” she said on Wednesday.\n\nIn the weeks ahead, a trial will be held in the Senate, the partisan narratives will continue, and Trump will likely remain in the Oval Office. The final verdict on the Trump impeachment will emerge next November. If Trump is defeated, the impeachment will emerge as a political masterstroke by Pelosi, which used the Party’s House majority to hold Trump accountable and unify Democrats. If Trump wins, the impeachment will be declared the first of myriad Democratic missteps that allowed a vulnerable President to secure reëlection. On Wednesday, Pelosi placed not only Trump’s legacy but her own at risk. Widely considered the shrewdest and most disciplined Democratic legislative leader of her generation, she has taken a bold risk with the Trump impeachment. History will decide if it was a reckless or worthy gamble.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8b2bc86f2c9a2449bd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c8b2bc86f2c9a2449bd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Nancy

Pelosi](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/nancy-pelosi), a Democrat from California and the Speaker of the House, opened the floor debate in an irreconcilable House of Representatives on the impeachment of President Donald Trump. It promises to be a legacy-defining day for Pelosi, one that is expected to end in a historic rebuke of Trump. Only two other American Presidents have been impeached. The final tally will also exhibit anew the country’s unrelenting political divisions. In all likelihood, Trump will be acquitted next month, in a similarly one-sided, partisan manner, in the Senate. It is a depressingly predictable set of outcomes and one that will, inevitably, raise questions about both the point of the entire exercise and the wisdom of Pelosi’s decision to pursue impeachment in the first place.\n\nAmid the cascade of news conferences, public statements, and interviews that Pelosi has given since she launched the formal impeachment inquiry, in late September, a particular moment stands out. Earlier this month, at the end of her weekly [news conference](https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/12519-7), Pelosi had begun to walk off the stage when a reporter from the conservative Sinclair Broadcast Group called out to her, “Do you hate the President, Madam Speaker?” Pelosi wheeled around and wagged her index finger at him. “I don’t hate anybody,” she said. “I was raised in a Catholic house. We don’t hate anybody. Not anybody in the world.” She stalked back to the microphone. “This is about the Constitution of the United States and the facts that lead to the President’s violation of his oath of office,” Pelosi said. Then she added, “I still pray for the President. I pray for the President all the time. So, don’t mess with me when it comes to words like that.” \n\nIt was the spilling-over of emotion from Pelosi that was arresting—evidence of the immense political, psychological, and constitutional pressures bearing down on her. In the past, the Speaker has frequently made the same assertion: that she was praying for the President. Some may question her sincerity, but her insistence that she was doing so, even as she was seeking to remove him from office, felt in keeping with the solemnity of her handling of impeachment over the past few months. By contrast, on Tuesday, in [a rambling, six-page letter](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/17/us/politics/trump-pelosi-letter.html) to Pelosi, Trump accused her of “offending Americans of faith by continually saying ‘I pray for the President,’ when you know this statement is not true, unless it is meant in a negative sense. It is a terrible thing you are doing, but you will have to live with it, not I!”\n\nAll along, the dilemma of impeachment for Democrats has been twofold: political and constitutional. The former has been much debated. Pelosi had long resisted the entreaties of her party’s more liberal members to impeach Trump. When she finally relented, she kept the investigation narrowly focussed on the [Ukraine affair](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/11/04/how-trumps-emissaries-put-pressure-on-ukraines-new-president), and ultimately settled on a tight timetable for concluding the inquiry. After an initial rise in support, [public](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/public_approval_of_the_impeachment_inquiry_of_president_trump-6956.html) [opinion](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/impeachment-polls/) on impeachment has held fairly steady throughout congressional hearings and remains deeply polarized. Much of Pelosi’s strategizing has revolved around a need to protect vulnerable Democrats in Trump-supporting districts who helped secure the Party’s House majority in the 2018 midterm elections. In recent days, many in this group have come out in support of impeachment. For them, however, the political risks of a prolonged inquiry seemed substantial. \n\nThe constitutional conundrum that Pelosi faced has received far less attention, but it arguably carries more significant long-term implications. It rests on a reality of opposing truths: that impeaching Trump over the Ukraine affair is both an essential step for safeguarding American democracy and a potentially dangerous one for its future. Trump’s pressure on Ukraine for the purposes of influencing the 2020 election is precisely the kind of grave offense from the executive branch that the Framers designed the impeachment clause to guard against. But the implacable partisanship of the modern era threatens the future legitimacy of impeachment as a tool for Congress, and increases the likelihood that it will become just another weapon in an unrestrained partisan war.\n\nFor all the second-guessing of Pelosi’s actions, it is difficult to conceive of a responsible alternative path to the one she chose. Failing to impeach Trump would have set a dangerous precedent—that Presidents can subvert American foreign policy for their own ends, without fear of consequences. Weeks of Republican obduracy in the committee hearings, however, demonstrated the quandary she confronted: impeachment cannot function properly in an age of hyper-partisanship. “To succeed, an impeachment must transcend party conflict,” Laurence Tribe and Joshua Matz write in their book “[To End a Presidency](https://www.amazon.com/End-Presidency-Power-Impeachment/dp/1541644883).” “Since the 1990s, however, impeachment has become increasingly entangled with the daily grind of partisan politics. As a result, the president’s political opponents are quick to frame their major disagreements in terms of impeachment. The president’s supporters, in turn, are quick to dismiss even legitimate impeachment talk as a partisan conspiracy to nullify the last election.” In the past few months, Democrats have satisfied their responsibilities, under the Constitution, to conduct a sober fact-finding inquiry, but their Republican counterparts have steadfastly refused to fulfill theirs.\n\nThere is a legitimate argument to be made that Democrats should have continued their investigation and worked through the courts to compel the testimony of additional witnesses, including current and former senior White House officials. Yet it is hard to imagine the broad contours of the case changing in any significant way. \n\nThe political calculus, then, becomes paramount. Pelosi—the first woman to lead her party in Congress and the first female Speaker of the House—has long been known as a shrewd tactician. Impeachment has revealed, once again, that the stakes for 2020, in Congress and the White House, are not just about one party or another but whether facts and the truth still have a place in American political life. For Democrats, all there is to do now is to press ahead with their constitutional duty—and, perhaps, like Pelosi, pray for their Republican antagonists.\n\n*This post was updated after Pelosi initiated the floor debate over impeachment.*","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8b2bc86f2c9a2449bd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Nancy Pelosi","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"nancy-pelosi"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5c2e1ca42396212cbb9fc9d1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"House of Representatives","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"house-of-representatives"},{"id":"5c2e1dc036cecf4019214339","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"U.S. Constitution","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"us-constitution"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5919d9ce0efe820724926ba0","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Michael Luo is the editor of newyorker.com and oversees the magazine’s digital presence across all platforms.

Johnson quoted Fiona Hill, a former national-security official who, in [testimony](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-extraordinary-impeachment-testimony-of-fiona-hill?verso=true) before the House Intelligence Committee, had described a “blowup” she had had with [Gordon Sondland](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/02/gordon-sondlands-impeachment-testimony-for-the-ages), the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union, with regard to Ukraine. After hearing Sondland’s own testimony to the committee, Hill said, she’d had an epiphany about the source of their conflict: though she’d believed that they were both engaged in the grand mission of foreign policy, the President had actually dispatched Sondland on “a domestic political errand.”\n\nThat errand, Johnson said, was to make Ukrainian officials “an offer they could not refuse.” In the words of the first of two articles of impeachment that the Judiciary Committee’s clerk read on Thursday morning, at the start of a tense and long debate, [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) “corruptly solicited” the Ukrainians, attempting to trade military aid and a White House meeting for two investigations. One involved a specific conspiracy theory about Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election; the other concerned Vice-President Joe Biden and his son [Hunter](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/will-hunter-biden-jeopardize-his-fathers-campaign). Trump wanted Ukraine “to target an American citizen,” Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, said. Democrats have described this scheme, with some justice, as extortion or bribery, but the charge in the first article is abuse of power.\n\nThe Republicans on the committee used the debate to try to peddle a different story. “Show me the Ukrainian that was pressured!” Matt Gaetz, of Florida, said, although multiple witnesses had already testified that a number of Ukrainians were. Ken Buck, of Colorado, brought up the money that Hunter Biden received as a member of the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, and argued that Trump was within his rights to ask for an investigation: “This isn’t smearing. This is seeking the truth about corruption.” (Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, argued that Trump’s truth-seeking impulse arose only after Joe Biden declared his Presidential candidacy.) And Jim Jordan, of Ohio, offered his theory on what the meaning of “us” was when Trump, in the now infamous July 25th phone call with President [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/11/04/how-trumps-emissaries-put-pressure-on-ukraines-new-president?verso=true) of Ukraine, said, “I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot.” This “us” was not “the royal we,” reflecting a request for a personal favor, Jordan said, but an example of Trump’s “working on behalf of the American people.” In case that didn’t clear things up, Jordan had a simpler explanation for why anyone would want to impeach Trump. “They don’t like us,” he said. “All of us common folk in Ohio, Wisconsin, Tennessee, and Texas.” Republican after Republican goaded the Democrats with the notion that they were just scared that Trump would win again.\n\nThe focus of the first article of impeachment is, of course, what Trump has already done to try to secure that victory—namely, enlist foreign officials in his reëlection campaign. His [demand for the Ukrainian investigations](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/23/the-ukrainian-prosecutor-behind-trumps-impeachment?verso=true), according to the charge, was not a backward-looking effort to get to the bottom of a corruption case but an attempt to anticipate and influence the 2020 election. That prospective threat is one reason the Democrats have given for moving the articles of impeachment along with great speed. They do not pretend that they have collected all the available evidence. For that shortfall, they have blamed what Jamie Raskin, of Maryland, described as Trump’s “blockading and intimidating.” At the President’s direction, witnesses under subpoena have failed to appear, and the Administration has refused to turn over documents. (During the debate, Andy Biggs, Republican of Arizona, offered the weak riposte that no “retribution” had been inflicted on the witnesses who did testify.) There are court fights under way now over the subpoenas, but the Democrats, rather than wait, made the President’s defiance the subject of the second article of impeachment: obstruction of Congress.\n\n“The President _is_ the smoking gun,” Pramila Jayapal, of Washington, said, adding, with a slightly too picturesque extension of the metaphor, “The smoking gun is already reloaded. And whether or not it gets fired—that’s up to us.” At a press conference on Tuesday, during which Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi introduced the two articles, Adam Schiff, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, said that to ask “Why not wait?” is the equivalent of asking “Why not let him cheat just one more time?” That may be a resounding appeal, but on its own terms it doesn’t make much sense. The rushed timeline almost certainly means that impeachment is hurtling toward an acquittal for the President in the Republican-controlled Senate by February, with nine months left before the election. A longer investigation might have been a better way to monitor and restrain Trump; it’s worth remembering that his call to Zelensky came the day after the testimony of the special counsel [Robert Mueller](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/robert-mueller) in the House, which, he felt, had lifted a “phony cloud” from over his head.\n\nThis schedule may help get moderate congressional Democrats reëlected and the Democratic senators who are running for President back out on the campaign trail (and get Hunter Biden out of the spotlight). But, adding to the sense of missed opportunities, the articles largely bypass other issues that have been raised about Trump, such as violations of the emoluments clause and matters covered in the Mueller report—notably, a long list of possible examples of obstruction of justice.\n\nThe hearings in the Judiciary Committee provided a sad confirmation of the likelihood of the President’s acquittal. “Do we have abuse of power? Yes: Adam Schiff!” Guy Reschenthaler, Republican of Pennsylvania, shouted. He added that the committee had voted down his attempt to subpoena the whistle-blower: “That is obstruction of Congress!” (By way of compensation, Louie Gohmert, Republican of Texas, recited a list of names that included a person suspected of being the whistle-blower.) In the coming trial, the tone of the Republican senators may be more restrained, but it is unlikely to be more edifying.\n\nVal Demings, of Florida, was one of several Democrats who spoke of the historic weight of the moment, and to an extent she was right: Trump will always be a President who was impeached, and the two articles describing his offenses will be scrutinized in textbooks. But domestic politics impose their own burden. Not one of the House Republicans is expected to vote yes on either article. They know their President, and they know their errand. ♦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"sections":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"comment"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a01ff019dfc3494ea4158","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Amy Davidson Sorkin has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 2014.

But what did the result mean for the right? In an [essay](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-british-test-for-the-populist-revolution-11575647973) published shortly before the election, Gerard Baker, the *Wall Street Journal’s* editor-at-large, said that, if [Boris Johnson’s](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/boris-johnson) “new national populist party wins on Thursday, it will be a model that will be studied by ambitious conservatives across the West.” On Monday, Walter Russell Mead, a historian at Bard College, also writing in the *Journal*, [hailed](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lessons-from-the-tory-landslide-11576540523?mod=opinion_lead_pos9) Johnson’s effort to create “what we might call National Conservatism,” a “pro-enterprise political approach that is nevertheless grounded in the traditional sentiments and loyalties of the people.”\n\nBaker and Mead were both grappling with the fact that Johnson’s Conservative Party, which was long dominated by affluent residents of suburban and rural areas, now has a big working-class contingent. In the election, it picked up dozens of seats in the north of England that have voted Labour for decades. This development has been attributed to Johnson’s promise of a rapid [Brexit](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brexit) and the unpopularity of [Jeremy Corbyn](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jeremy-corbyn), the Labour leader. But it also represented the continuation of a deeper trend. Labour’s share of the working-class vote has been falling for decades. Last Thursday, according to a [survey](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/12/17/how-britain-voted-2019-general-election) of voters by the polling firm YouGov, only a third of the British working class—defined in terms of occupational categories—voted for Labour. The Conservatives’ share of the working-class vote, meanwhile, hit a new high of [forty-eight per cent](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-election-factbox/factbox-uk-election-conservative-gains-and-losses-idUSKBN1YH061). (The rest was split among other parties.)\n\nTo some extent, the result of the British election mimicked that of the 2016 U.S. election, when many white working-class Americans warmed to Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric, and also to his promises to reduce immigration and protect U.S. jobs—a program that [Steve Bannon](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/steve-bannon), his former campaign chief, has referred to as “economic nationalism.” In [an interview](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/17/steve-bannon-working-class-republicans-labour) with the *Guardian* that was published on Tuesday, Bannon hailed the British-election result, and, turning his attention closer to home, boasted, “We’ve turned the Republican party into a working-class party.”\n\nDespite the U.S. election result in 2016, that blanket statement was misleading: the G.O.P. still has the support of many affluent people, including religious conservatives, small-business owners, and conservative plutocrats. It would be equally misleading to refer to the Conservative Party as a working-class party. The reality is that it now represents an awkward coalition of traditional shire Tories, free-enterprise conservatives, and working-class voters. But, on both sides of the Atlantic, politics is in flux. Amid a continuing dealignment of traditional voting patterns, based on income and class, the major political parties are trying to put together new electoral coalitions and new messaging architectures. The terms “economic nationalism,” “National Conservatism,” and “national populist” represent right-wing entries in the messaging contest. But what do they really amount to? And do they provide a long-term basis for holding together the new Republican and Conservative coalitions? The answers aren’t yet clear.\n\nAfter Trump’s election, his economic nationalism turned out to encompass a feed-the-plutocrats tax cut, a still-to-be-constructed [border wall](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/border-wall), and a series of tariffs on Chinese goods which have failed to reverse decades of globalization and deindustrialization. In the past couple of years, the trade deficit with China has risen, while job growth in manufacturing and agriculture, two sectors particularly sensitive to trade, have stagnated. As an [article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/16/business/trump-midwest-swing-jobs.html) in the *Times* pointed out on Monday, employment growth has been particularly slow in some of the Midwestern states that are key to Trump’s reëlection strategy. Not entirely coincidentally, he has just called a truce in his trade war.\n\nIn my opinion, the President’s continuing popularity with Republican voters—working-class and non-working-class—has less to do with protectionism and economic nationalism than it does with the continued strength of the broader economy, his assiduous cultivation of social and racial resentments, and his unceasing depiction of himself as a foe and victim of the Washington establishment. In this sense, demagoguery and the cult of personality seem at least as important as economics.\n\nAlthough Johnson is often compared to Trump, he is more of a mainstream Conservative politician—albeit a very slippery one. In last week’s election, his appeal appears to have been largely transactional and situational: he promised to put an end to the Brexit paralysis, and he wasn’t Corbyn. Going forward, though, what sort of economic panacea can he offer the gritty northern towns that voted Conservative—places like Bishop Auckland, Blyth Valley, Burnley, Leigh, and Scunthorpe, all of which have suffered decades of deindustrialization?\n\nSome of Johnson’s allies hold up a [post-Brexit vision of the United Kingdom](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2019/08/12/boris-johnsons-real-agenda-the-singapore-scenario/) as a North Atlantic version of Singapore: an entrepreneurial trading powerhouse. With the country’s access to the vast European market about to be restricted, that is a fantasy. Far from moving into Britain, many multinational companies may well reconsider their existing investments there. (Some of them already are.) By ending freedom of movement into the United Kingdom from other countries in the the European Union, Brexit may well stem the inflow of Poles, Romanians, Bulgarians and other Europeans seeking work, which will please some of Johnson’s supporters. But, on its own, Brexit certainly won’t revive the struggling post-industrial towns that voted Conservative; it is far more likely to hurt them.\n\nSome observers are suggesting that, to counter the negative effects of Brexit and maintain the support of these towns, Johnson and the Conservatives will eventually abandon their commitment to a balanced budget, borrowing large sums to finance increases in government spending and instituting new tax cuts. Trump abandoned fiscal rectitude long ago, of course. (It’s not clear that he even knows what it means.) In fiscal year 2019, which ended in September, the budget deficit was almost a trillion dollars, and in October and November it [rose](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/12/11/business/ap-us-budget-deficit.html) even further on a monthly basis. \n\nIf Johnson went in this direction, he could conceivably fund substantial increases in spending on the National Health Service and other public programs and combine it with some get-tough policies on immigration and crime. (He’s already [proposed](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5dda924905da587992a064ba_Conservative%202019%20Manifesto.pdf) hiring more police, enabling stop-and-frisk, and introducing tougher custodial sentences for criminals.) This type of left-right combo might prove popular with many ex-Labour voters. However, it would amount to abandoning the identity of the Conservatives as the guardians of sound finance and the enemies of profligate spending. The Party’s election manifesto, far from hinting at such a shift, pledged that “debt will be lower at the end of the parliament—rather than spiraling out of control under Labour.”\n\nTo be sure, working-class conservatism (or conservative populism, or economic nationalism, or whatever you want to call it) is now a powerful force on both sides of the Atlantic. But in Britain it is still very much a work in progress, and in the United States it is closely connected to one man, and his appeal. How durable it proves to be remains to be seen.

In terms of parliamentary seats, which are ultimately what counts, the Labour Party suffered its [worst outcome since 1935](https://apnews.com/374f433de02f3ffda9747ca38bd894a4). This disastrous result certainly represented a sweeping repudiation of [Corbyn](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jeremy-corbyn), the left-wing leader of the Party. Public anger about the [Brexit](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brexit) stalemate—a uniquely British imbroglio that Johnson ruthlessly exploited—also played a key role in the result. Another complicating factor is that Labour’s progressive economic proposals actually polled pretty well. (Arguably, they forced Johnson to dilute the Conservatives’ traditional commitment to fiscal austerity.) In any case, all of these things make it trickier than it might seem to make transatlantic comparisons.\n\nSeveral Labour Party veterans whom I spoke with on Friday insisted that the lousy result for Labour came down to Corbyn’s political persona proving anathema to the Party’s traditional working-class base—and there are some opinion-poll data that bear this out. In a [survey](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy-corbyn-biggest-reason-voters-21092578) carried out after the vote, Opinium Research asked people who had defected from Labour to the Conservatives what the main factors in their vote had been. Forty-five per cent identified the Party’s leadership—i.e., Corbyn—and thirty-one per cent pointed to its wishy-washy Brexit policy, which avoided taking any firm stance; although Corbyn eventually endorsed a second referendum on whether to leave the European Union or remain, he said he wouldn’t take a stance either way on that vote.\n\nIn a [column](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/general-election-results-2019-jeremy-corbyn-labour-leadership-a9246311.html) for the *Independent*, Anna Turley, a Labour politician who lost her parliamentary seat in Redcar, an industrial seaside town in the northeast of England, put the blame squarely on Corbyn. In canvassing her constituency, she recalled, “for every time Brexit was raised on the doorsteps, the leadership was raised four more—even by those sticking with us. There was visceral anger from lifelong Labour voters who felt they couldn’t vote for the party they had supported all their lives because of ‘that man at the top.’&nbsp;”\n\nAlthough he is sometimes compared to [Bernie Sanders](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/bernie-sanders), Corbyn is a very English figure: a sincere but dour ideologue who has spent most of his political life as a fixture of left-wing protest movements. He had been a regular columnist for the *Morning Star*, a newspaper of the far left that has historical ties to the Communist Party of Great Britain, from where he expressed support for leftist liberation movements in the developing world and criticized American imperialism. In 2015, shortly after he took over as Labour’s leader, [he refused to sing](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/15/jeremy-corbyn-silent-during-national-anthem-battle-of-britain-service) the national anthem—“God Save the Queen”—during a memorial service for the Battle of Britain, the air war, in 1940, in which the Royal Air Force fought off Hitler’s marauding Luftwaffe. Acts like this were unlikely to go down well in the former mining villages and steel towns that flipped to the Tories on Thursday.\n\nAs the national-anthem example indicates, Corbyn isn’t a very skilled politician—or, alternatively, he is a man of such high principle that he refuses to trim his positions at all to win votes. It is tempting to regard him as left-wing puritan, but some of his gestures just seem daft and self-defeating. A couple of weeks ago, during an [interview](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000bqpt) with the BBC’s Andrew Neil, Corbyn repeatedly declined to issue a direct apology to Britain’s Jewish community for the Labour Party’s mishandling of allegations and instances of anti-Semitism in the Party, even though he had issued such an apology [previously](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-politics/uk-labour-leader-corbyn-apologizes-for-anti-semitism-in-his-party-idUSKBN1H10VR). Rather than just repeating it and moving on, he doggedly stood his ground, thus insuring that the next day’s [headlines](https://news.sky.com/story/general-election-jeremy-corbyn-addresses-antisemitism-row-after-chief-rabbi-attack-11870789) were mostly about anti-Semitism instead of Labour’s policies or his attacks on Johnson.\n\nIf Corbyn is sui generis, so is the Brexit morass. In Turley’s piece for the *Independent*, she writes that her constituents were also angry about “the paralysis in politics” since the 2016 Brexit vote. For more than three years, the House of Commons successfully frustrated efforts by the former Prime Minister Theresa May and her successor, Johnson, to get a Brexit bill passed, but it couldn’t come up with an alternative.  Johnson and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, sensed the intense public frustration and built their entire election campaign around the [slogan](https://time.com/5749478/get-brexit-done-slogan-uk-election/) “Get Brexit Done.”\n\nLike [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)’s “Make America Great Again,” Johnson’s slogan was simple, catchy, and [misleading](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/24/there-is-no-more-deceptive-slogan-of-this-campaign-than-get-brexit-done). In January, the new Parliament will most likely pass Johnson’s Brexit-withdrawal bill, but it will take at least another year of negotiations with Brussels for his government to reach a final exit agreement with the European Union, and probably a good deal longer. Johnson didn’t linger on this during the campaign, of course. (He claims that he can get a final agreement by the end of 2020.) Instead, he hammered his time-for-action message relentlessly, including in the much discussed [campaign ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj-YK3JJCIU) that parodied a scene from the romantic comedy “Love Actually,” from 2003. The final shot showed Johnson in a cobbled street, saying, “Enough. Enough. Let’s get this done.” Like the infamous “Labour Isn’t Working” campaign poster that helped Margaret Thatcher to get elected in 1979, this ad was fiendishly effective. But, again, it highlighted a situation that is unique to Britain, and which won’t have any bearing on the U.S. election.\n\nOf course, that won’t stop people from identifying links for their own purposes. On Friday, Al From, the founder of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, named names, drawing a direct line from the type of politics that Corbyn represents to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. “Jeremy Corbyn has a lot more despicable characteristics than either of them,” From told the *Guardian*. “But I do think that they represent an ideology that is going to be hard for a lot of American swing voters to accept, and that’s a danger.”\n\nSetting aside From’s personal attack on Corbyn, an important question is whether Britain’s voters did actually reject the elements that Labour’s policy platform shares with those that Warren and Sanders are putting forward, which include substantial increases in government programs and public investment financed by higher taxes on the rich. When the pollster YouGov asked British voters, last month, about the proposals contained in Labour’s election manifesto, it found that most of them were pretty popular—and the most popular of all was raising the tax rate to fifty per cent for income above a hundred and twenty-three thousand pounds. Almost two-thirds of respondents expressed support for this proposal, and just one in five [said](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tactical-voting-blog/labour-manifesto-policies-popular-polling-nationalise-tax-rising-a9214276.html) that she was opposed to it.\n\nEven some of Labour’s more radical proposals received majority support. Fifty-six per cent of respondents said they favored placing Britain’s railways, which were privatized in the nineteen-nineties, back under public ownership. Fifty-four per cent said they favored forcing corporations to overhaul their governance structures and insure that a third of their board members were workers’ representatives.\n\nOf course, polling numbers like these shouldn’t necessarily be interpreted at face value. Voters often say that they support individual policies of progressive and left-wing parties, but history suggests that getting the public to elect such parties to government requires a plausible, persuasive leader and a favorable environment. With Corbyn and Brexit, the Labour Party had neither. In drawing lessons from what happened on Thursday, these things shouldn’t be forgotten.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274662","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Brexit","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"brexit"},{"id":"5c2e1c8a41c92e2c9b85da3c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Jeremy Corbyn","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"jeremy-corbyn"},{"id":"5c2e1cb92bfcc72cd92d0585","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Boris Johnson","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"boris-johnson"},{"id":"5c2e20a67e716b454591b096","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"British Elections","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"british-elections"},{"id":"5c2e1c762710c62d10815407","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

The Conservatives now have three hundred and sixty-four members of Parliament—a majority of almost eighty over the the other parties—and enormous freedom to govern for the next five years. The vote is a turning point. It is the best result for the Tories since 1987, and the first time since the days of Margaret Thatcher that the Party has decisively won the argument about the future of the country. The argument, of course, was about [Brexit](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brexit), at least for Johnson. “Get Brexit Done” was his slogan and sole focus. For Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party, whose election manifesto was anything but myopic—an eye-catching grab-bag of progressive ideas to address inequality and climate change, arranged around a complicated Brexit policy—this was a disaster. The party held on to just two hundred and three seats in the House of Commons, its worst result since the Depression, and more or less in line with the defeat of Michael Foot, its most recent radical left-wing leader, in 1983\\. Foot’s election manifesto was memorably described as “the longest suicide note in history.” This morning, Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into its next election, but hinted that he would stick around for “a period of reflection” while the Party figures out what to do. Johnson was more succinct. “We have defeated Corbyn,” he said.\n\n \n\nIt was a terrible night for the United Kingdom. Johnson and the Conservatives can look forward to great power in London in the coming years, but Scotland, Northern Ireland, England, and Wales increasingly look like nations coming apart. The Scottish National Party, which opposes Brexit and wants independence, won forty-eight out of fifty-nine seats in Scotland. The Party’s leader, Nicola Sturgeon, said that she would write to Johnson before Christmas to request another referendum to break the union with England, which has lasted for three hundred and twelve years. “I have a mandate to give Scotland a choice for an alternative future,” she said. One nationalism breeds another. In Northern Ireland, which under Johnson’s Brexit deal will be separated from mainland Britain by a regime of customs checks, the Conservatives’ former allies, the Democratic Unionist Party, lost two of its ten seats. The D.U.P.’s veteran leader in Parliament, Nigel Dodds, lost his seat, in North Belfast, to John Finucane, a Sinn Fein candidate whose father was murdered by pro-union terrorists during the Troubles. “North Belfast rejects Brexit,” Finucane said. “North Belfast is a Remain constituency and wants a future as part of the European Union.” Johnson must now hold a creaking entity together. This morning, he described the Conservatives as “a great one-nation party,” meaning that they represent the whole of the U.K. But there is only one nation where Brexit and Johnson’s populism have truly flourished, and that is England. There the map is Conservative blue.\n\n \n\nThe questions for Labour are existential. Under Tony Blair, the Party merged its historic base in Scotland and the industrial north of England with metropolitan liberals and floating commuter voters in the south. Two elections ago, in 2015, the S.N.P. virtually banished Labour from Scotland, stripping the Party of around forty M.P.s. Last night, Labour lost another fifty-nine seats, this time in former mining and manufacturing communities across the north, where it had dominated the vote since the First World War. In Blyth Valley, a constituency north of Newcastle, the Conservatives won for the first time since 1950, when the electoral district was created. In Blair’s old parliamentary seat of Sedgefield, the Labour vote collapsed by seventeen per cent. The new M.P., Paul Howell, is the first Conservative to represent the town since 1931\\. Many of the seats that Labour lost were in parts of the country that voted to leave the European Union three years ago. This morning, Johnson acknowledged that, in places like Burnley, Bassetlaw, and Bishop Auckland, which has voted for Liberal and Labour M.P.s since 1885, people had turned to the Conservatives to deliver Brexit. The Prime Minister described leaving the E.U. as now the “irrefutable, irresistible, unarguable decision of the British people.” He said that he would work flat-out to enact it. “You may intend to return to Labour next time round,” Johnson said. “If that is the case, I am humbled that you have put your trust in me, and I will never take your support for granted.”\n\nBut Brexit alone does not explain Labour’s weak performance. Since 2016, the Party has stretched and strained to accommodate its traditional supporters, many of whom voted for Brexit. Corbyn himself is no fan of the E.U. The trouble is that Labour’s demographic coalition—the British equivalent of the group that the Democratic Party must hold together in 2020—is losing its glue. Corbyn’s metropolitan socialism, his big-ticket nationalizations and green industrial strategy, did not cut it in communities that had voted Labour for generations. They were ideas that came from somewhere else. In Bolsover, Derbyshire, Dennis Skinner, Labour’s eighty-seven-year-old M.P., had held office since before his Conservative opponent was born. Like seventy per cent of his constituents, Skinner supported Brexit. But he lost by more than five thousand votes. Mark Fletcher, who won the seat for the Tories, told the *Financial Times* that Corbyn’s unpopularity had been decisive. “Anti-Corbyn sentiment was the biggest thing I picked up on the doorstep,” Fletcher said. “Brexit would be number two. Number three would be the sense of not being listened to, taken for granted.”\n\n \n\nWhat does Johnson’s victory mean? In short order, it means that the debate over Brexit, which has traumatized British politics for the past three and a half years, is over. With a compliant House of Commons, Johnson will take the country out of the E.U. on January 31st. He will also have considerable leeway in the trade negotiations that follow. Johnson has promised to settle a new free-trade deal with the E.U. by the end of 2020\\. Most experts and diplomats agree that this is impossible, but Johnson will have a rancorous British Parliament cheering him on. No one on the right will stand up to him. Everyone else will hope that a softer, less divisive Johnson will emerge, now that he has been elected Prime Minister by the population as a whole. This morning, there has already been speculation that Johnson will use his margin of victory to pivot to the center—negotiating a close partnership with the E.U. and governing as a moderate—but this is based on nothing at all. Rejoicing at Conservative Party headquarters, Johnson sounded almost dazed by what had happened. “We must now understand the earthquake we have created, the way in which we have changed the political map of this country,” he said. “We must grapple with the consequences of that.” [President Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) tweeted his congratulations, teasing the offer of “a massive new Trade Deal after BREXIT” to the U.K. Those entreaties will be hard to resist, as will the political instincts that have carried Johnson this far.

In terms of parliamentary seats, which are ultimately what counts, the Labour Party suffered its [worst outcome since 1935](https://apnews.com/374f433de02f3ffda9747ca38bd894a4). This disastrous result certainly represented a sweeping repudiation of [Corbyn](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jeremy-corbyn), the left-wing leader of the Party. Public anger about the [Brexit](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brexit) stalemate—a uniquely British imbroglio that Johnson ruthlessly exploited—also played a key role in the result. Another complicating factor is that Labour’s progressive economic proposals actually polled pretty well. (Arguably, they forced Johnson to dilute the Conservatives’ traditional commitment to fiscal austerity.) In any case, all of these things make it trickier than it might seem to make transatlantic comparisons.\n\nSeveral Labour Party veterans whom I spoke with on Friday insisted that the lousy result for Labour came down to Corbyn’s political persona proving anathema to the Party’s traditional working-class base—and there are some opinion-poll data that bear this out. In a [survey](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy-corbyn-biggest-reason-voters-21092578) carried out after the vote, Opinium Research asked people who had defected from Labour to the Conservatives what the main factors in their vote had been. Forty-five per cent identified the Party’s leadership—i.e., Corbyn—and thirty-one per cent pointed to its wishy-washy Brexit policy, which avoided taking any firm stance; although Corbyn eventually endorsed a second referendum on whether to leave the European Union or remain, he said he wouldn’t take a stance either way on that vote.\n\nIn a [column](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/general-election-results-2019-jeremy-corbyn-labour-leadership-a9246311.html) for the *Independent*, Anna Turley, a Labour politician who lost her parliamentary seat in Redcar, an industrial seaside town in the northeast of England, put the blame squarely on Corbyn. In canvassing her constituency, she recalled, “for every time Brexit was raised on the doorsteps, the leadership was raised four more—even by those sticking with us. There was visceral anger from lifelong Labour voters who felt they couldn’t vote for the party they had supported all their lives because of ‘that man at the top.’&nbsp;”\n\nAlthough he is sometimes compared to [Bernie Sanders](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/bernie-sanders), Corbyn is a very English figure: a sincere but dour ideologue who has spent most of his political life as a fixture of left-wing protest movements. He had been a regular columnist for the *Morning Star*, a newspaper of the far left that has historical ties to the Communist Party of Great Britain, from where he expressed support for leftist liberation movements in the developing world and criticized American imperialism. In 2015, shortly after he took over as Labour’s leader, [he refused to sing](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/15/jeremy-corbyn-silent-during-national-anthem-battle-of-britain-service) the national anthem—“God Save the Queen”—during a memorial service for the Battle of Britain, the air war, in 1940, in which the Royal Air Force fought off Hitler’s marauding Luftwaffe. Acts like this were unlikely to go down well in the former mining villages and steel towns that flipped to the Tories on Thursday.\n\nAs the national-anthem example indicates, Corbyn isn’t a very skilled politician—or, alternatively, he is a man of such high principle that he refuses to trim his positions at all to win votes. It is tempting to regard him as left-wing puritan, but some of his gestures just seem daft and self-defeating. A couple of weeks ago, during an [interview](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000bqpt) with the BBC’s Andrew Neil, Corbyn repeatedly declined to issue a direct apology to Britain’s Jewish community for the Labour Party’s mishandling of allegations and instances of anti-Semitism in the Party, even though he had issued such an apology [previously](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-politics/uk-labour-leader-corbyn-apologizes-for-anti-semitism-in-his-party-idUSKBN1H10VR). Rather than just repeating it and moving on, he doggedly stood his ground, thus insuring that the next day’s [headlines](https://news.sky.com/story/general-election-jeremy-corbyn-addresses-antisemitism-row-after-chief-rabbi-attack-11870789) were mostly about anti-Semitism instead of Labour’s policies or his attacks on Johnson.\n\nIf Corbyn is sui generis, so is the Brexit morass. In Turley’s piece for the *Independent*, she writes that her constituents were also angry about “the paralysis in politics” since the 2016 Brexit vote. For more than three years, the House of Commons successfully frustrated efforts by the former Prime Minister Theresa May and her successor, Johnson, to get a Brexit bill passed, but it couldn’t come up with an alternative.  Johnson and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, sensed the intense public frustration and built their entire election campaign around the [slogan](https://time.com/5749478/get-brexit-done-slogan-uk-election/) “Get Brexit Done.”\n\nLike [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)’s “Make America Great Again,” Johnson’s slogan was simple, catchy, and [misleading](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/24/there-is-no-more-deceptive-slogan-of-this-campaign-than-get-brexit-done). In January, the new Parliament will most likely pass Johnson’s Brexit-withdrawal bill, but it will take at least another year of negotiations with Brussels for his government to reach a final exit agreement with the European Union, and probably a good deal longer. Johnson didn’t linger on this during the campaign, of course. (He claims that he can get a final agreement by the end of 2020.) Instead, he hammered his time-for-action message relentlessly, including in the much discussed [campaign ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj-YK3JJCIU) that parodied a scene from the romantic comedy “Love Actually,” from 2003. The final shot showed Johnson in a cobbled street, saying, “Enough. Enough. Let’s get this done.” Like the infamous “Labour Isn’t Working” campaign poster that helped Margaret Thatcher to get elected in 1979, this ad was fiendishly effective. But, again, it highlighted a situation that is unique to Britain, and which won’t have any bearing on the U.S. election.\n\nOf course, that won’t stop people from identifying links for their own purposes. On Friday, Al From, the founder of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, named names, drawing a direct line from the type of politics that Corbyn represents to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. “Jeremy Corbyn has a lot more despicable characteristics than either of them,” From told the *Guardian*. “But I do think that they represent an ideology that is going to be hard for a lot of American swing voters to accept, and that’s a danger.”\n\nSetting aside From’s personal attack on Corbyn, an important question is whether Britain’s voters did actually reject the elements that Labour’s policy platform shares with those that Warren and Sanders are putting forward, which include substantial increases in government programs and public investment financed by higher taxes on the rich. When the pollster YouGov asked British voters, last month, about the proposals contained in Labour’s election manifesto, it found that most of them were pretty popular—and the most popular of all was raising the tax rate to fifty per cent for income above a hundred and twenty-three thousand pounds. Almost two-thirds of respondents expressed support for this proposal, and just one in five [said](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/tactical-voting-blog/labour-manifesto-policies-popular-polling-nationalise-tax-rising-a9214276.html) that she was opposed to it.\n\nEven some of Labour’s more radical proposals received majority support. Fifty-six per cent of respondents said they favored placing Britain’s railways, which were privatized in the nineteen-nineties, back under public ownership. Fifty-four per cent said they favored forcing corporations to overhaul their governance structures and insure that a third of their board members were workers’ representatives.\n\nOf course, polling numbers like these shouldn’t necessarily be interpreted at face value. Voters often say that they support individual policies of progressive and left-wing parties, but history suggests that getting the public to elect such parties to government requires a plausible, persuasive leader and a favorable environment. With Corbyn and Brexit, the Labour Party had neither. In drawing lessons from what happened on Thursday, these things shouldn’t be forgotten.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274662","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274662","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Brexit","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"brexit"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Brexit","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"brexit"},{"id":"5c2e1c8a41c92e2c9b85da3c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c8a41c92e2c9b85da3c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Jeremy

2020?","pubDate":"2019-12-14T20:39:32.478Z","related":[{"id":"5defac53297f3d0008d7007c","modelName":"article","collection":"articles","body":"-=-=-=-\n\nSpeaking before dawn at Conservative Party headquarters on Friday morning, [Boris Johnson](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/boris-johnson) celebrated “a huge, great stonking mandate” from the British people, after his party won an overwhelming victory in Thursday’s election. The Conservatives now have three hundred and sixty-four members of Parliament—a majority of almost eighty over the the other parties—and enormous freedom to govern for the next five years. The vote is a turning point. It is the best result for the Tories since 1987, and the first time since the days of Margaret Thatcher that the Party has decisively won the argument about the future of the country. The argument, of course, was about [Brexit](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brexit), at least for Johnson. “Get Brexit Done” was his slogan and sole focus. For Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party, whose election manifesto was anything but myopic—an eye-catching grab-bag of progressive ideas to address inequality and climate change, arranged around a complicated Brexit policy—this was a disaster. The party held on to just two hundred and three seats in the House of Commons, its worst result since the Depression, and more or less in line with the defeat of Michael Foot, its most recent radical left-wing leader, in 1983\\. Foot’s election manifesto was memorably described as “the longest suicide note in history.” This morning, Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into its next election, but hinted that he would stick around for “a period of reflection” while the Party figures out what to do. Johnson was more succinct. “We have defeated Corbyn,” he said.\n\n \n\nIt was a terrible night for the United Kingdom. Johnson and the Conservatives can look forward to great power in London in the coming years, but Scotland, Northern Ireland, England, and Wales increasingly look like nations coming apart. The Scottish National Party, which opposes Brexit and wants independence, won forty-eight out of fifty-nine seats in Scotland. The Party’s leader, Nicola Sturgeon, said that she would write to Johnson before Christmas to request another referendum to break the union with England, which has lasted for three hundred and twelve years. “I have a mandate to give Scotland a choice for an alternative future,” she said. One nationalism breeds another. In Northern Ireland, which under Johnson’s Brexit deal will be separated from mainland Britain by a regime of customs checks, the Conservatives’ former allies, the Democratic Unionist Party, lost two of its ten seats. The D.U.P.’s veteran leader in Parliament, Nigel Dodds, lost his seat, in North Belfast, to John Finucane, a Sinn Fein candidate whose father was murdered by pro-union terrorists during the Troubles. “North Belfast rejects Brexit,” Finucane said. “North Belfast is a Remain constituency and wants a future as part of the European Union.” Johnson must now hold a creaking entity together. This morning, he described the Conservatives as “a great one-nation party,” meaning that they represent the whole of the U.K. But there is only one nation where Brexit and Johnson’s populism have truly flourished, and that is England. There the map is Conservative blue.\n\n \n\nThe questions for Labour are existential. Under Tony Blair, the Party merged its historic base in Scotland and the industrial north of England with metropolitan liberals and floating commuter voters in the south. Two elections ago, in 2015, the S.N.P. virtually banished Labour from Scotland, stripping the Party of around forty M.P.s. Last night, Labour lost another fifty-nine seats, this time in former mining and manufacturing communities across the north, where it had dominated the vote since the First World War. In Blyth Valley, a constituency north of Newcastle, the Conservatives won for the first time since 1950, when the electoral district was created. In Blair’s old parliamentary seat of Sedgefield, the Labour vote collapsed by seventeen per cent. The new M.P., Paul Howell, is the first Conservative to represent the town since 1931\\. Many of the seats that Labour lost were in parts of the country that voted to leave the European Union three years ago. This morning, Johnson acknowledged that, in places like Burnley, Bassetlaw, and Bishop Auckland, which has voted for Liberal and Labour M.P.s since 1885, people had turned to the Conservatives to deliver Brexit. The Prime Minister described leaving the E.U. as now the “irrefutable, irresistible, unarguable decision of the British people.” He said that he would work flat-out to enact it. “You may intend to return to Labour next time round,” Johnson said. “If that is the case, I am humbled that you have put your trust in me, and I will never take your support for granted.”\n\nBut Brexit alone does not explain Labour’s weak performance. Since 2016, the Party has stretched and strained to accommodate its traditional supporters, many of whom voted for Brexit. Corbyn himself is no fan of the E.U. The trouble is that Labour’s demographic coalition—the British equivalent of the group that the Democratic Party must hold together in 2020—is losing its glue. Corbyn’s metropolitan socialism, his big-ticket nationalizations and green industrial strategy, did not cut it in communities that had voted Labour for generations. They were ideas that came from somewhere else. In Bolsover, Derbyshire, Dennis Skinner, Labour’s eighty-seven-year-old M.P., had held office since before his Conservative opponent was born. Like seventy per cent of his constituents, Skinner supported Brexit. But he lost by more than five thousand votes. Mark Fletcher, who won the seat for the Tories, told the *Financial Times* that Corbyn’s unpopularity had been decisive. “Anti-Corbyn sentiment was the biggest thing I picked up on the doorstep,” Fletcher said. “Brexit would be number two. Number three would be the sense of not being listened to, taken for granted.”\n\n \n\nWhat does Johnson’s victory mean? In short order, it means that the debate over Brexit, which has traumatized British politics for the past three and a half years, is over. With a compliant House of Commons, Johnson will take the country out of the E.U. on January 31st. He will also have considerable leeway in the trade negotiations that follow. Johnson has promised to settle a new free-trade deal with the E.U. by the end of 2020\\. Most experts and diplomats agree that this is impossible, but Johnson will have a rancorous British Parliament cheering him on. No one on the right will stand up to him. Everyone else will hope that a softer, less divisive Johnson will emerge, now that he has been elected Prime Minister by the population as a whole. This morning, there has already been speculation that Johnson will use his margin of victory to pivot to the center—negotiating a close partnership with the E.U. and governing as a moderate—but this is based on nothing at all. Rejoicing at Conservative Party headquarters, Johnson sounded almost dazed by what had happened. “We must now understand the earthquake we have created, the way in which we have changed the political map of this country,” he said. “We must grapple with the consequences of that.” [President Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) tweeted his congratulations, teasing the offer of “a massive new Trade Deal after BREXIT” to the U.K. Those entreaties will be hard to resist, as will the political instincts that have carried Johnson this far. During the campaign, he made strikingly few promises—there was Brexit, some more police, a few new hospitals—and nothing much else. Johnson has achieved a momentous political triumph through discord, populism, and a few bon mots. Why on earth would he stop now?","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cb92bfcc72cd92d0585","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Boris Johnson","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"boris-johnson"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274662","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Brexit","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"brexit"},{"id":"5c2e1c8c41e4c73c088d7784","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"United Kingdom","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"united-kingdom"}],"sections":[{"id":"5a85c96108ed787fc1cfd378","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Letter from the U.K.","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"letter-from-the-uk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a73a4e65be2f29d55df9","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Sam Knight is a staff writer at *The New Yorker* based in London.

Johnson, who replaced Theresa May as the leader of the Conservative Party this past summer, was forced to call a vote because his narrow parliamentary majority was not sufficient for him to pass the [Brexit](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brexit) deal he negotiated with Europe. The results will likely lead to a renewed independence push by pro-European Scottish nationalists. They have already caused a shakeup in the Labour Party, which has been led for the past four years by the leftist [Jeremy Corbyn](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jeremy-corbyn) and had its worst election results in decades. On Friday, Corbyn said that he hoped to lead the Party during a period of “reflection” but would not do so in any future election. Corbyn, who ran on a platform of left-wing economic policies, such as nationalizing utilities and raising taxes on corporations, is [distrusted by many voters](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-the-uk/a-tired-britain-trudges-to-the-polls), in part because of his reluctance to take a clear position on Brexit and recent incidents of anti-Semitism within the Labour Party. \n\nTo analyze the results, I spoke by phone with David Runciman, a professor of politics at Cambridge University, a frequent contributor to the *London Review of Books* and the host of its “Talking Politics” podcast, and the author of the book “[How Democracy Ends](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1541616782/?creativeASIN=1541616782&linkCode=w61&imprToken=n98mEA4Ju1cxuvo5CSdJIg&slotNum=0&tag=thneyo0f-20).” During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed the roots of Boris Johnson’s remarkable political success, the future of Labour, and the election’s lessons for center-left parties around the world. \n\n__You [wrote](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v41/n23/david-runciman/bj-plus-brexit-or-jc-plus-2-refs) in an essay last month, “Because Corbyn has proved so intransigent while remaining so incompetent, all the cards keep falling Johnson’s way.” Is Corbyn’s leadership failure the main reason you think this election went the way it did?__\n\nYep. I think there were two things going on here. It was clearly a Brexit election and clearly a Corbyn election. The Labour Party is going to gain some votes in some parts of the country. It is going to do O.K. in London, it is going to do O.K. in some university towns where Corbynism is popular. But Corbyn and Corbynism are catastrophes in a lot of traditional Labour seats that voted Leave. People will argue for a long time about whether Corbyn or Brexit takes a bigger share of the blame, but they go together, and the Corbyn project is done. \n\n__Corbyn is both a strong leftist and someone who basically hedged or triangulated on the single biggest issue of the campaign: Brexit. Do you view his political failure as being more about one of these things than the other?__ \n\nI think that the hedge was a problem in the sense that something beats nothing in politics, and one party had a very clear position on Brexit, and one party had a much less clear position. But, more than that, I think the Labour position, for a lot of voters, meant more of the same, including another deal and another referendum. I think a lot of voters intuitively felt that that meant more confusion. When Theresa May last time tried to claim that she stood for something and Corbyn stood for confusion, people didn’t really buy it. People who were tempted to vote Labour thought the confusion was equally shared. This time, his position on Brexit just reinforced the idea that, if you wanted to know what would happen next, you had to vote Conservative. \n\nAnd then there is also the fact that, since Brexit happened, Corbyn and the Labour Party have made a series of missteps. A lot of people are already saying that Theresa May’s deal could have passed if Labour M.P.s had backed it. That would have kept Theresa May in her post, and British politics would look very different. Corbyn never gave a lead on that. Corbyn was hedging it all the way along. There have been moments where the Conservative Party could have been boxed in, and now Johnson and the Conservative Party have broken through, and Corbyn carries a lot of responsibility for that.  \n\n__Is there a specific thing you think he should have done?__\n\nThere will be people who will say that he should have resisted the election. Who knows? I think, in hindsight, what we are going to see is that there were opportunities, and yet there is a feeling that, when we look at seats that voted Conservative, these are seats that voted Leave, and it was always going to be challenging for any Labour Party to know how to deal with those seats. But it is hard to imagine anyone doing it worse than Corbyn has done. All the evidence from people canvassing was that, in these seats, Corbyn’s name was being mentioned a lot, and a lot of traditional Labour voters had turned on him.\n\n__What is the profile of these voters?__\n\nEssentially, they are working-class voters. This is not unique to this country, and it is not unique to the election. [The economist] Thomas Piketty has made this point repeatedly, which is that the workers aren’t voting for the parties of the center-left—our party is called the Labour Party, but it is no longer the party of labor. It is the party of university graduates, of big cities, and of young people, and the other crucial thing that will emerge when people break down the vote in this election is that there is here, as there was in the Brexit vote and the [Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) election, a big, big generational divide. Younger voters will still vote Labour, but we are learning with every one of these elections that younger voters will consistently be outvoted by people over the age of forty-five, and older voters in this election have gone overwhelmingly to the Conservatives, including older working-class voters.\n\n__Corbyn became more pro-Remain as the campaign went on. Should he have not done so and triangulated even more? Or do you view this election as essentially the same realignment based on education levels that we have seen over the past several years well beyond the United Kingdom, with not much to be done?__\n\nEducation and age are the new divides, and you need to be a very skillful politician to triangulate. He doesn’t have those skills. I don’t think there is an extra level of triangulation he could have pulled off, because he is not a convincing triangulator, and that is another part of the problem here. He never really actually became more Remain. What he did was accept that his party was going to have to commit to a second referendum. The problem was that he didn’t say how he would go in that vote. I think people continued to suspect that, in his heart of hearts, he was fine with Brexit happening, but that then makes him seem even weaker. \n\nWhat’s interesting about this election is that Corbyn is the same guy who ran against Theresa May, and people were gobsmacked on Election Night about how well he had done, picking up these seats that no one thought he could. And now here we are. He is still the same guy. He hasn’t changed much, and certainly the anti-Semitism charge has stuck much more, and it does seem that the Tories have hit home more on national-security questions. That seems to have made a difference. But he hasn’t changed in thirty years. What has changed is what the electorate thinks this election is about. And Johnson did have a stronger pitch than May did, not least that Johnson had a deal. And that deal will now pass. We are going to leave the European Union in six weeks. It is going to happen.\n\n__You said this means the end of the “Corbyn project.” Did you mean the Labour Party moving left on economics?__\n\nBy the “Corbyn project,” I mean something more distinctive than that. I think the Party will continue to move left. Its constituency is clear now. It has a strong appeal with younger voters and, crucially, in London. That is the other thing about the Corbyn project—it was a London project. And it is still holding up in London. But you can’t win Britain from London. You can’t win England from London. So I think the move to the left probably is here to stay for a while, anyway, and the membership—which is still a large membership—is still, I think, committed to many of the ideas. But the Corbyn project and some of the people around Corbyn are still tainted by not just the charges of anti-Semitism but the catastrophe of this election. And so the next version of Labour will have to have a different feel to it. And it will have to have something to say to older voters, and it will have to have something to say to voters who live not just in cities but in towns. And you can’t do that from North London. \n\n__And you assume this means a different leader?__\n\nYeah. Even in this campaign—it has been a Brexit campaign, and it is not at all clear that people are totally sold on a Johnson agenda. It is always said about Corbynism that many of the things he stood for are popular and have broad appeal. He found no way of communicating that appeal in electoral terms to older voters or voters in the North of England. The policies could appeal, but you need a different political skill set.  \n\n__Does this election make you change the way in which you thought about Boris Johnson as a political figure?__\n\nCertainly, I am surprised by the scale of this. It is worth pointing out about Boris Johnson that, if you take a step back, even before tonight, he is an amazingly successful electoral politician. Unlike Tony Blair, who won the elections he was expected to win, Johnson won elections he was not expected to win. He became Mayor of London when people said he couldn’t, then he won the Brexit referendum, then he became leader of the Conservative Party when people said he couldn’t, and now he has done this. Not even [Margaret Thatcher](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/12/02/its-still-mrs-thatchers-britain) has that track record of confounding what people like me sometimes naïvely think. He has something, and part of it is courage. He took a chance on Brexit and took a chance on this election. We still don’t know what kind of Prime Minister he will be with the power he has. For now, he is the great winner in British politics.\n\n__Are you concerned that Boris Johnson poses a threat to British democracy?__\n\nI’m not super concerned, nor do I think Trump is the end of democracy, although I think Trump is more of a threat than Johnson is. Johnson cut some corners, to put it mildly, in trying to force this issue and force Brexit through. Now that he has the parliamentary authority to do it, he doesn’t need to cut corners and can do it the conventional way, the way that Blair and Thatcher ruled, which is that his party will do what he tells them. That’s our version of democracy, but we have lost sight of it because we haven’t had a party with a large parliamentary majority since Blair in 2005\\. I don’t think Johnson is a firebrand and a wrecker in that sense. But it is a big problem with the British system that, if you give a Prime Minister a big parliamentary majority, there are very few limits on his power—especially in this case, because the Party has been purged of its dissidents, so this is a Johnson party. It is still democracy, but where the opposition is going to come from, I am not sure. \n\n__Johnson ran a campaign that stepped away from the austerity that his party had pursued for much of the decade and promised increased spending. Is your sense that Johnson will change the Tory Party, or that, like a lot of populists, he understood that these promises were popular but will govern like we would expect him to?__\n\nI don’t think he is going to go back to austerity and fiscal discipline. I think he is instinctively a deregulator. He and the people around him have some quite close connections to the think tanks in your country that push a deregulatory agenda, which is different from austerity. On the other hand, he is winning seats that are made up of people who are not just working class, but many of them are dependent on welfare and living fairly precarious lives. And, though he doesn’t need to have another election for five years if he doesn’t want one, the people who have been elected in these constituencies will remind him that that is the new Conservative base. He will spend some money on welfare, and he will also deregulate, and part of the Brexit project is getting out of regulations. \n\n__Once Brexit occurs, how much will that settle the issue of Europe, and how much will a pro-European agenda be a feature of left-liberal politics going forward?__\n\nThe first stage of Brexit will be leaving the institutions, and then the future of the economic relationship and trade relationship will have to be negotiated, and that will be another huge fight. Johnson will be under pressure from some people in his party for a harder break, and from others who will want to make sure it doesn’t damage these new constituencies in industrial areas. I think it will be hard for the main party of the left to become a Go Back In party. It will be too soon for that. A lot will happen in European politics, too. We are not the only country where a lot is up in the air. Before the next British general election, Europe will have changed Europe, too. And Johnson is going to be a dominant figure in European politics, too. They now look at a politician who is more secure than any of they are.\n\n__What is this likely to mean for the future of Scotland?__\n\nIt looks like the Scottish National Party has won almost every seat in Scotland, which would be a remarkable thing. The map will be a very conservative England with a Labour London, and then Scotland will be another country completely. The showdown that is coming is the demand of the Scottish nationalists for another independence referendum, and Johnson having said he would refuse. Both sides have been strengthened by the result, and that will be a massive fight, and I can’t tell you how it will play. I suspect that, in twelve months’ time, that will be as big a fight as Brexit.\n\nOne of the remarkable things about this result is that it is incredibly hard to win a majority at all in British politics, because Scotland has gone [to the S.N.P.]. Now you have to win a majority without any chance of winning more than a couple seats in Scotland. There is no one who has done this. Even when Thatcher was winning big majorities and struggling in Scotland, she still managed to win some seats in Scotland. It looks like Johnson is winning big without Scotland.\n\n__I don’t want to read this all through an American lens, but there have been a ton of Johnson and Trump comparisons. And I do find it shocking how well Johnson did. The Conservatives have presided over a circus these past few years, and a bad economy, and they are still going to win a huge majority of seats. Trump is presiding over a good economy and has very little chance of getting a plurality of votes.__\n\nI will say a few things on that, and I am really interested in this transatlantic comparison. I think the economic conditions are different in 2019 than they were in 2017\\. May called an election when wages were falling, and you should never do that. Wages have been rising for a while, although not dramatically. That makes a huge difference. The economy is not going like the American economy is, but in some ways it is in slightly better shape than it was a couple years ago. The Tories are getting a plurality, but less than Trump. Blair won a huge majority of seats on about thirty-five per cent of the vote.\n\n__Right, I meant that Trump wasn’t going to win a huge plurality of the popular vote, as Johnson will.__\n\nI take your point, and the Electoral College has its own quirks, too. You can tell me the extent to which people in the Democratic Party have been looking at Corbyn as a bellwether, and after tonight it doesn’t look good. The central demographic fact of Western democracy is that there aren’t enough young people, and whoever is taking on Trump needs to focus on the crucial fact that we are the first societies in human history where the old outnumber the young. There are lots of different ways to appeal across generations, but at the moment these kinds of projects do not look as though they have done so successfully, and that would be one of my takeaways from this result. Corbyn is different from [Bernie] [Sanders](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/bernie-sanders) in lots of ways, and tainted in lots of ways, not the least of which is that he has been the leader of an opposition that has to do real politics in Parliament, and he has struggled. \n\nPeople will say that this shows what will happen to Sanders. I wouldn’t buy that for a minute. But there are some broader lessons, and I think the generation divide and the educational divide are the new divides, and they play out geographically, because of where college towns are and where older and younger people tend to live. The left has got to bridge those divides or the left is going to lose, because there are more old people and people who haven’t been to college.

But, in actuality, the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee spent much of their time talking about—you guessed it—Hunter Biden. \n\nDuring the morning session, the committee voted along party lines to reject a G.O.P. effort to strike the first article of impeachment, which accuses Trump of abusing his Presidential power by pressuring the President of Ukraine to dig up dirt on his domestic political rivals. After that, Representative Matt Gaetz, a Republican whose district is in the Florida Panhandle, introduced a separate amendment. This one would have struck the reference to Joe Biden in the first article of impeachment and replaced it with a reference to his son and to Burisma, the Ukrainian company that added Hunter to its board for a time.\n\nGaetz, a Trump überloyalist and an N.R.A. favorite who once introduced legislation to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency, began by rambling on about what Hunter Biden did or didn’t do for Burisma. Then he brought up the younger Biden’s history of drug problems, reading a passage from a [lengthy Profile of him](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/will-hunter-biden-jeopardize-his-fathers-campaign), by *The New Yorker’s* Adam Entous, which describes how on one occasion “a white powdery substance” was found in a rental car he had driven. “I don’t want to make light of anybody’s substance-abuse issues,” Gaetz said. “But it’s a little hard to believe that Burisma hired Hunter Biden to resolve their international disputes when he could not resolve his own dispute with Hertz rental cars over leaving cocaine and a crack pipe in the car.”\n\nEven by the base standards of today’s House G.O.P., which often resembles a ragtag protest group more than a government party, this was a slimy effort at diversion. “This is about distraction, distraction, distraction,” the veteran Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee, of Texas, accurately pointed out. But it was left to Hank Johnson, a seven-term Democratic congressman from Georgia, to deliver the most effective put-down of Gaetz. “The pot calling the kettle black is not something that we should do,” Johnson said. “I don’t know what members, if any, have had any problems with substance abuse, been busted in a D.U.I.—I don’t know. But, if I did, I wouldn’t raise it against anyone on this committee.” The titters that went around the hearing room as Johnson was speaking indicated that at least some of those present knew what he was referring to.\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\nLate one night in 2008, a police deputy stopped Gaetz’s car, for speeding, not far from the congressman’s home. In his incident report, the deputy said that Gaetz smelled of beer and that “his eyes were watery and bloodshot, and he swayed and staggered when he got out of the car.” The deputy arrested Gaetz and took him to a police station, where he was booked and photographed. For reasons that have never been entirely clear, the charges against Gaetz were later dropped. But, in an interview with the Tampa Bay *Times*, in 2014, Gaetz acknowledged that he had “made bad decisions that resulted in an arrest” and added, “That is sort of something that we all live with.”\n\nIf you think, for a moment, that Johnson’s rebuke was sufficient to shame Gaetz into silence, you haven’t been paying attention for the past few months. In their fealty to Trump, many members of the House G.O.P. are entirely shameless and more than a bit bonkers. Given a second opportunity to speak, Gaetz brought up Hillary Clinton—why not?—and said he was just glad that the country now had a President who is concerned about corruption.\n\n\nHe wasn’t the only Republican to speak in favor of his amendment, of course. Another was Louie Gohmert, the Texan who once issued a dire warning about “terror babies” and who, on Wednesday night, as the hearing started, read out the name of an official who has been identified, in some reports, as the intelligence whistle-blower. In weighing in on Gaetz’s amendment, Gohmert followed his example and brought up Clinton. He also offered a novel theory that she was somehow responsible for the Democrats’ impeachment of Trump. “What we continue to see is projection,” Gohmert said. “Someone on their side engages in illicit conduct and that is what they accuse President Trump of doing.”\n\nWithin the confines of a supposedly serious congressional hearing, there is no wholly effective way to counter the sort of slime and gibberish that Gaetz and Gohmert were promoting. In any case, it wasn’t directed at Americans who are undecided about the merits of impeaching Trump, if any such people exist. Its only purpose was to fire up the Trump faithful, go viral on right-wing Web sites, and, perhaps, even get picked up on Fox News. In other words, it was part of politics as a tribal ritual rather than politics as rational discourse, and, therefore, it was largely immune to rational counter-argument.\n\nSome of the Democrats on the committee tried their best, anyway, to remind people why Joe Biden’s name was the one included in the first article of impeachment. In doing so, these Democrats focussed on the actual acts at the center of the impeachment investigation—acts that most of the Republicans on the panel had assiduously avoided or deliberately downplayed.\n\nJackson Lee pointed out that Trump had put aid to Ukraine on hold despite the fact that the State Department and other U.S. agencies had stated that the country was already in compliance with anti-corruption directives. Hakeem Jeffries, the chair of the House Democratic Caucus, read out a list of the names of witnesses, Trump appointees all, who confirmed that the President had pressured a foreign government to target a U.S. citizen: Biden. Zoe Lofgren, who represents a district in Silicon Valley, said that, although the behavior of Hunter Biden and of Trump’s sons and daughters were things that voters could consider in a general election, “here we are talking about the abuse of Presidential authority.” \n\nThat final statement was a bit incomplete. In referring to “we,” Lofgren should have made clear that she wasn’t including the Republicans on the committee. If there was one thing they were determined not to talk about, it was Trump abusing his power or doing anything wrong.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5c2e25e441c92e2c9b85ddf6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e25e441c92e2c9b85ddf6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"House

House Speaker [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/nancy-pelosi), fresh from the press conference in which she and some colleagues unveiled [two articles of impeachment](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/Articles%20of%20Impeachment.pdf) against [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)—for abusing his power and obstructing Congress—was walking briskly down a hallway where Manu Raju, CNN’s senior congressional correspondent, was doing a standup. Raju broke away from his spiel to lob an important question at Pelosi: Why hadn’t the Democrats included an article for obstruction of justice? (The Mueller report detailed ten Trump actions that looked like blatant efforts to obstruct the Russia investigation.) The Speaker didn’t even break her step as she replied, “We are doing the U.S.M.C.A.”\n\nThat’s the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a successor to the *NAFTA*{:.small} trade deal, which is one of the Trump Administration’s biggest legislative priorities. Pelosi was on her way to a second press conference, where she portrayed the new trade accord, which was finalized over the weekend in talks between senior Democrats and Robert Lighthizer, Trump’s trade czar, as a victory for American workers. “There is no question, of course, that this trade agreement is much better than *NAFTA*{:.small}, but in terms of our work here it is also infinitely better than what was initially proposed,” Pelosi said. She also pointed to the endorsement of the deal by Richard Trumka, the head of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., who had been pushing for stronger protections for American workers to be included.\n\nThe timing of the two press conferences was remarkable, and quite deliberate. Pelosi hasn’t hidden the fact that she was [a reluctant convert](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-president-gave-us-no-choice-pelosi-resisted-trumps-impeachment-now-shes-the-public-face/2019/12/05/56f31916-1774-11ea-a659-7d69641c6ff7_story.html) to the impeachment cause. Before taking the vows, in the wake of the revelations about Ukraine, she gave several reasons for her skeptical attitude, on one occasion saying that Trump wasn’t worth the trouble. The real reason for Pelosi’s caution was political. She feared impeachment would generate a backlash that would reverse the [blue wave](https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/a-week-after-the-midterm-elections-the-blue-wave-continues-to-grow) in 2018, which saw the Democrats banishing Republicans from suburban districts in California, New Jersey, and other states to gain forty-one seats in the House and take control.\n\nEven though Pelosi is now firmly behind impeachment on the grounds that Trump’s effort to extort the [President of Ukraine](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/11/04/how-trumps-emissaries-put-pressure-on-ukraines-new-president) into providing him with dirt on his domestic opponents was just too egregious to ignore, these fears still appear to be prominent in her mind. On the eve of last month’s public hearings before the House Intelligence Committee, according to a story in the Washington *Post*, she warned her fellow Democratic leaders that they wouldn’t trigger a dramatic shift in public opinion about impeachment. The FiveThirtyEight [impeachment tracker](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/impeachment-polls/) indicates that she was right about that, and Pelosi sent a message on Tuesday morning that she won’t allow impeachment to upend her strategy for retaining the districts that the Democrats won in 2018\\.\n\nShe could have scheduled the announcement of an agreement on the trade deal for tomorrow or next week. But, by holding it right after the unveiling of articles of impeachment, she demonstrated that, even as she and her colleagues are trying to drive Trump out of office, they are also focussing on bread-and-butter matters, such as lowering the cost of prescription drugs, guaranteeing paid leave for federal workers, and enshrining labor protections in trade agreements. Her message is that, in order to make progress in these areas, House Democrats are even willing to coöperate with a President whom they are impeaching. The dual announcements got this across in a manner that reassured some centrist members of her caucus. \n\nPolitical strategizing also helps to explain why there are only two articles of impeachment. According to numerous reports, [Jerry Nadler](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jerry-nadler), the head of the House Judiciary Committee, considered also filing an obstruction-of-justice charge arising from the Mueller report, which explained, among many other things, how Trump ordered Don McGahn, the former White House counsel, to have [Robert Mueller](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/robert-mueller), the special counsel, fired. That order, which McGahn wisely ignored, clearly amounted to an effort to obstruct justice. From the beginning, though, Pelosi has insisted on keeping the impeachment inquiry narrowly focussed on Ukraine, probably because she thinks returning to the Russia investigation would play poorly in swing districts. With the support of [Adam Schiff](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/adam-schiff), the head of the House Intelligence Committee, she has got her way.\n\nSimilarly, Pelosi and Schiff rebuffed calls for them to slow down the impeachment process. Such a pause might have given the courts time to force Mick Mulvaney, [John Bolton](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/06/john-bolton-on-the-warpath), and others to testify about what they know, and also to make the Administration hand over crucial documents, such as White House records about the decision to place a hold on security assistance to Ukraine. In Tuesday morning’s press conference, Schiff said that such a legal battle could drag on for eight to sixteen months, which seemed like a pessimistic assessment. In any case, though, it is evident that Pelosi and he don’t want the impeachment process to continue deep into 2020.\n\nUnderlying all this is the assumption, unspoken but widely acknowledged on the Democratic side, that the Republicans in the Senate will vote to acquit Trump, and attention will then switch to the election campaign. If Pelosi had believed that there was a realistic chance of removing Trump from office, she might have endorsed a broader and lengthier impeachment process. As it is, the first article of impeachment says that Trump is a President who “betrayed the Nation by abusing his high office to enlist a foreign power in corrupting democratic elections.” The second article says that Trump, in stonewalling congressional efforts to investigate the Ukraine scandal, has “abused the powers of the Presidency in a manner offensive to, and subversive of, the Constitution.” For Nancy Pelosi, that is enough.

The ranking Republican on the committee, Doug Collins, of Georgia, responded by saying, “We don’t have a crime,” and accusing Democrats of carrying out a conspiracy to force [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) out of office. Over the next nine hours, the partisan brawl that had been expected unfolded, ending in shouts and denunciations. \n\nThe proceedings that took place a few blocks away after lunch were more decorous but more alarming. The Justice Department Inspector General, Michael Horowitz, released a long-awaited report on whether the F.B.I. properly conducted its Trump-Russia investigation in 2016\\. The four-hundred-and-thirty-four-page document posits that major mistakes were made. F.B.I. officials repeatedly omitted facts that would have undermined their applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for a wiretap of the former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. But Horowitz concluded that the over-all investigation was legally justified and not politically biased. That conclusion refutes years of President Trump’s claims that he and his campaign were the victims of a conspiracy. \n\nMinutes later, Attorney General [William Barr](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/william-barr), the country’s top law-enforcement official, took a highly unusual and likely unprecedented step. Without presenting any evidence, Barr flatly dismissed Horowitz’s core findings. “The Inspector General’s report now makes clear that the F.B.I. launched an intrusive investigation of a U.S. presidential campaign on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken,” Barr said in [a statement](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/statement-attorney-general-william-p-barr-inspector-generals-report-review-four-fisa).\n\nIn an even more unorthodox step, John Durham, a federal prosecutor whom Barr had appointed to carry out a separate investigation of the F.B.I.’s work, chimed in with his own public statement. Durham, who has not yet concluded his probe but had seen a draft of the Inspector General’s report, also criticized Horowitz. “Last month, we advised the Inspector General that we do not agree with some of the report’s conclusions as to predication and how the F.B.I. case was opened,” [Durham said](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ct/pr/statement-us-attorney-john-h-durham). \n\nThroughout the day, the procedures, norms, and practices that govern two of the most serious processes carried out by government—impeaching a President and reviewing a federal investigation—were shredded. Members of Congress talked past one another. So did the country’s top law-enforcement officials. The public was not well served.\n\n \n\nOne thing that was clear, though, was that the practice of American politics and criminal justice is changing. Trump, through his facts-be-damned statements and take-no-prisoners tweets, has led the way. And his approach to politics is catching—rapidly and rampantly among Republicans and even, more gradually, among Democrats. Democrats, arguably, are cutting corners as they push ahead with their plans for a House impeachment vote by the end of next week. Republicans are demonstrating that they will dismiss any finding, evidence, or fact that does not fit the President’s political narrative.\n\n \n\nLast week, [Jonathan Turley](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-the-law-professors-brought-to-the-trump-impeachment-hearings), a constitutional-law expert whom the Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee called as a witness, testified that Trump’s attempt to pressure Ukraine’s President into launching a criminal investigation of the Biden family was improper. But Turley also argued that it was not an impeachable offense. Will Hurd, a moderate Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, adopted that stance as well. On Monday, Republican after Republican on the committee said that the President had done nothing wrong. He had not committed a single questionable act. Stephen Castor, a Republican lawyer for the committee, dismissed the impeachment proceedings as “baloney” and “a lot of hyperbole and hysteria.”\n\n \n\nA similar dynamic defined the response to the Inspector General’s report. The product of two years of investigation and hundreds of interviews, Horowitz’s conclusions were not merely questioned by Republicans; they were derided. Senator [Lindsey Graham](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/audience-of-one-why-flattery-works-in-trumps-foreign-policy) said the F.B.I.’s Trump-Russia investigation had become a “criminal enterprise.”\n\n \n\n[James Baker](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/public-servants-versus-donald-trump), who served as the F.B.I.’s general counsel when the Bureau conducted the investigation, welcomed Horowitz’s refutation of Trump’s long-running intimations of an F.B.I. coup. “On the major question that has been vexing the country and been the subject of many of the President’s pronouncements, yes, I feel vindicated,” Baker told me. “There was no hoax, there was no plot, there was no coup.”\n\n \n\nBaker said that the mistakes and omissions committed by agents were “completely unacceptable” and that the Bureau officials who were involved should be held accountable. He feared that the announcements from Barr and Durham “could easily sow confusion in the public’s mind.” Baker added, “It doesn’t help the public understand the I.G. report, because their statements are conclusory and not supported by meaningful facts. They just come forward with innuendo and generalizations.”\n\nJames Clapper, whose work as the director of National Intelligence in 2016 is being investigated by Durham, predicted that Durham’s investigation would drag on through the 2020 election because of its political value to the President. “This investigation will go on in some form for as long as the Trump Administration is in office,” he told me. As for Horowitz’s report, “There’s something in it for everyone.  It won’t resolve anything.” \n\nThe distance between the parties is growing. The anger is real—and palpable. The danger in the short term is that the public throws up its hands and tunes out the process. The danger in the long term is that a President gets away with subverting the system.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1d7041c92e2c9b85db21","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Impeachment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"impeachment"},{"id":"5c2e1d5b7e716b454591ae82","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"F.B.I.","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"fbi"},{"id":"5c2e1c852bfcc72cd92d053b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Russia Investigation","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"russia-investigation"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"59244985edd5556de3868e32","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"David Rohde is an executive editor of newyorker.com.

He has done it again. On Wednesday, he signed an executive order that will allow federal funds to be withheld from colleges where students are not protected from anti-Semitism—using an absurdly defined version of what constitutes anti-Semitism. Recent precedent and the history of legislative efforts that preceded the executive order would suggest that its main targets are campus groups critical of Israeli policies. What the order itself did not make explicit, the President’s son-in-law did: on Wednesday, Jared Kushner published [an Op-Ed in the *Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/opinion/jared-kushner-trump-anti-semitism.html) in which he stressed that the definition of anti-Semitism used in the executive order “makes clear what our administration has stated publicly on the record: Anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism.”\n\nBoth Kushner and the executive order refer to the definition of anti-Semitism that was formulated, in 2016, by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance; it has since been adopted by the State Department. The definition supplies examples of anti-Semitism, and Kushner cited the most problematic of these as the most important: “the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity”; denial to “the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor”; and comparing “contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.” All three examples perform the same sleight of hand: they reframe opposition to or criticism of Israeli policies as opposition to the state of Israel. And that, says Kushner, is anti-Semitism.\n\nTo be sure, some people who are critical of Israeli policies are opposed to the existence of the state of Israel itself. And some of those people are also anti-Semites. I am intimately familiar with this brand of anti-Semitism, because I grew up in the Soviet Union, where anti-Zionist rhetoric served as the propaganda backbone of state anti-Semitism. The word “Zionist,” when deployed by *Pravda*, served as incitement to violence and discrimination against Soviet Jews. All of this can be true at the same time that it is also true that Israel has effectively created an apartheid state, in which some Palestinians have some political rights and the rest have none. Human-rights organizations such as Breaking the Silence and B’Tselem—Israeli groups, founded and run by Jews—continue to document harrowing abuse of Palestinians in Israel, the occupied West Bank, and Gaza. \n\nIn August, I went on [a tour designed by Breaking the Silence](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/a-guided-tour-of-hebron-from-two-sides-of-the-occupation) that aims to show Israelis and foreigners what the occupation looks like. This particular tour ended in a Palestinian village which has been largely overtaken by an Israeli settlement that is illegal under international law. One of the Palestinian houses ended up on territory claimed by the settlers, so the settlers built a chain-link cage around the house, the yard, and the driveway. A young Palestinian child, who is growing up in a house inside a cage, waved to us through the fencing. Comparing this sort of approach to Nazi policies may not make for the most useful argument, but it is certainly not outlandish. The memory of the Holocaust stands as a warning to humanity about the dangers of dehumanizing the other—and invoking that warning in Palestine is warranted.\n\nOne does not have to be an anti-Semite to be an anti-Zionist, but one certainly can be both an anti-Semite and an anti-Zionist. Trump, however, has inverted this formula by positioning himself as a pro-Zionist anti-Semite. He has proclaimed his support often for the state of Israel. His Administration’s policies, which have included moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and, more recently, declaring that the U.S. does not view Israeli settlements in the West Bank as illegal, have pleased the state of Israel, especially its most militantly expansionist citizens. Over the weekend, however, at the Israeli American Council National Summit, in Florida, Trump [gave a speech](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/09/politics/donald-trump-accused-of-anti-semitic-language/index.html) that brimmed with Jewish stereotypes: Jews and greed, Jews and money, Jews as ruthless wheeler-dealers. “A lot of you are in the real estate business because I know you very well,” he said. \"You’re brutal killers, not nice people at all.” It was the kind of stuff that requires no definitions, op-eds, or explanations—it was plain, easily recognizable anti-Semitism. And it was not the first time that Trump trafficked in anti-Semitic stereotypes. The world view behind these stereotypes, combined with support for Israel, is also recognizable. To Trump, Jews—including American Jews, some of whom vote for him—are alien beings whom he associates with the state of Israel. He finds these alien beings at once distasteful and worthy of a sort of admiration, perhaps because he ascribes to them many of the features that he also recognizes in himself.\n\nIt should come as no surprise that anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S. increased by sixty per cent during the first year of Trump’s Presidency, according to the Anti-Defamation League. The current year is on track to set a record for the number of anti-Semitic attacks. The latest appears to have [occurred on Tuesday](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/untangling-the-hate-at-the-heart-of-the-mass-shooting-in-jersey-city), when shooters reportedly connected to a fringe group targeted a kosher supermarket in Jersey City, killing four people.\n\nThe new executive order will not protect anyone against anti-Semitism, and it’s not intended to. Its sole aim is to quash the defense—and even the discussion—of Palestinian rights. Its victim will be free speech.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ccb397f5b30646d065a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1ccb397f5b30646d065a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Anti-Semitism","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"anti-semitism"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Anti-Semitism","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"anti-semitism"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald

This argument is about imagination, and it may be a deeper, more important conversation than it seems.\n\nIn a Monday-evening live stream, Representative [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/23/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-historic-win-and-the-future-of-the-democratic-party), of New York, called the U.S.’s detention facilities for migrants “concentration camps.” On Tuesday, she [tweeted](https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1140968240073662466) a link to an [article](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a27813648/concentration-camps-southern-border-migrant-detention-facilities-trump/) in *Esquire* in which Andrea Pitzer, a historian of concentration camps, was quoted making the same assertion: that the United States has created a “concentration camp system.” Pitzer argued that “mass detention of civilians without a trial” was what made the camps concentration camps. The full text of Ocasio-Cortez’s tweet was “This administration has established concentration camps on the southern border of the United States for immigrants, where they are being brutalized with dehumanizing conditions and dying. This is not hyperbole. It is the conclusion of expert analysis.” Hackles were immediately raised, tweets fired, and, less than an hour and a half later, Representative Liz Cheney, of Wyoming, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Liz_Cheney/status/1140988893627478018), “Please @AOC do us all a favor and spend just a few minutes learning some actual history. 6 million Jews were exterminated in the Holocaust. You demean their memory and disgrace yourself with comments like this.” A high-pitched battle of tweets and op-eds took off down the much travelled dead-end road of arguments about historical analogies. These almost never go well, and they always devolve into a virtual shouting match if the Holocaust, the Nazis, or Adolf Hitler is invoked. One side always argues that nothing can be as bad as the Holocaust, therefore nothing can be compared to it; the other argues that the cautionary lesson of history can be learned only by acknowledging the similarities between now and then.\n\n----------\n\n__Read:__ *[Isaac Chotiner](http://newyorker.com/contributors/isaac-chotiner)’s [interview with Warren Binford](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/inside-a-texas-building-where-the-government-is-holding-immigrant-children), a lawyer disturbed by what she saw while interviewing immigrant children held in American detention facilities.*\n\n----------\n\nBut the argument is really about how we perceive history, ourselves, and ourselves in history. We learn to think of history as something that has already happened, to other people. Our own moment, filled as it is with minutiae destined to be forgotten, always looks smaller in comparison. As for history, the greater the event, the more mythologized it becomes. Despite our best intentions, the myth becomes a caricature of sorts. Hitler, or Stalin, comes to look like a two-dimensional villain—someone whom contemporaries could not have seen as a human being. The Holocaust, or the Gulag, are such monstrous events that the very idea of rendering them in any sort of gray scale seems monstrous, too. This has the effect of making them, essentially, unimaginable. In crafting the story of something that should never have been allowed to happen, we forge the story of something that couldn’t possibly have happened. Or, to use a phrase only slightly out of context, something that can’t happen here.\n\nA logical fallacy becomes inevitable. If this can’t happen, then the thing that *is* happening is not it. What we see in real life, or at least on television, can’t possibly be the same monstrous phenomenon that we have collectively decided is unimaginable. I have had many conversations about this in Russia. People who know Vladimir Putin and his inner circle have often told me that they are not the monsters that I and others have described. Yes, they have overseen assassinations, imprisonments, and wars, but they are not thoroughly terrible, my interlocutors have claimed—they are not like Stalin and his henchmen. In other words, they are not the monsters of our collective historical imagination. They are today’s flesh-and-blood monsters, and this makes them seem somehow less monstrous.\n\nAnything that happens here and now is normalized, not solely through the moral failure of contemporaries but simply by virtue of actually existing. Allow me to illustrate. My oldest son, who spent his early childhood in a Russian hospital, was for many years extremely small for his age. I spent useless hours upon hours in my study in Moscow, where we then lived, poring over C.D.C. growth charts. No matter how many times I looked, I couldn’t place him—he was literally off the chart. As far as the C.D.C. was concerned, my son, at his age, height, and weight, was unimaginable. When he was four, I took him to see a pediatrician in Boston. She entered his measurements into her computer, and a red dot appeared on the chart. I felt my body finally relax; my child was no longer impossible! He was on the chart. Then I realized that the pediatrician was working with an interactive chart. (This was in the early aughts, and there weren’t any available to me at home.) She had just put him in the system. His little red dot was still below the lowest, fifth-percentile curve. He was still the smallest child of his age. But a sort of cognitive trick had been performed. My son’s size had been documented, and this made him possible.\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) has [played this trick](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/under-trump-the-language-we-use-to-create-political-reality-is-crumbling) on Americans many times, beginning with his very election: first, he was impossible, and then he was President. Did that mean that the impossible had happened—an extremely hard concept to absorb—or did it mean that Trump was not the catastrophe so many of us had assumed he would be? A great many Americans chose to think that he had been secretly Presidential all along or was about to become Presidential; they chose to accept that, now that he was elected, his Presidency would become conceivable. The choice between these two positions is at the root of the argument between Ocasio-Cortez and the critics of her concentration-camp comment. It is not an argument about language. Ocasio-Cortez and her opponents agree that the term “concentration camp” refers to something so horrible as to be unimaginable. (For this reason, mounting a defense of Ocasio-Cortez’s position by explaining that not all concentration camps were death camps misses the point.) It is the choice between thinking that whatever is happening in reality is, by definition, acceptable, and thinking that some actual events in our current reality are fundamentally incompatible with our concept of ourselves—not just as Americans but as human beings—and therefore unimaginable. The latter position is immeasurably more difficult to hold—not so much because it is contentious and politically risky, as attacks on Ocasio-Cortez continue to demonstrate, but because it is cognitively strenuous. It makes one’s brain implode. It will always be a minority position.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7a2710c62d1081540c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"alexandria-ocasio-cortez"},{"id":"5c2e1c8481ab3335f580f17d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Concentration Camps","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"concentration-camps"},{"id":"5c2e20402710c62d10815700","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Liz Cheney","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"liz-cheney"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1f23425c632c6cd70791","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigrants, Immigration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigrants-immigration"},{"id":"5c2e1dd87e716b454591af01","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Family Separations","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"family-separations"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"},{"id":"5de9823481e049000849ee11","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2019 Top News","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2019-top-news"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a6e62e2e17730741c6b7","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Masha Gessen began contributing to *The New Yorker* in 2014 and became a staff writer in 2017\\.

He was referring, rather obliquely, to a spate of [recent bomb scares and acts of vandalism](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/st-louis-responds-to-a-rise-in-anti-semitism), part of an uptick in hate crimes that has occurred since his arrival on the political scene. Trump’s sentiment, however forced, was welcome, given the obtuseness, ambivalence, and even denial that have characterized his past responses to the problem. As a candidate and a President, he has seemed oddly untroubled by the license that anti-Semites derive from the us-against-them motif of his rants. But now, Trump says, the bigotry “has to stop, and it’s going to stop.”\n\n\n\n\n\nWould that it were that simple. Anti-Semitism is not a run-of-the-mill example of “hate and prejudice and evil,” which is why contempt for Jews keeps showing up as a symptom of social stress—even now, and even in the United States. One needn’t posit an “eternal anti-Semitism,” in Hannah Arendt’s warning phrase, to know that the imagination of the West has always defined itself positively against the negative other of Jewishness. That was blatantly the case in Germany in the sixteenth century, when Martin Luther characterized Jews as “vermin” within the German body politic, “a pest in the midst of our lands.” That belief ultimately came to flower, of course, in the exterminating anti-Semitism of Hitler, who saw the very existence of Jews as a mortal threat to the Thousand-Year Reich. But, as the Holocaust revealed, this fear infected both Nazi ideology and the broader Western consciousness. The crime of genocide may have been enacted by the Nazis, but Jews died as they did because the rest of Europe—and America, too—excluded them from moral concern.\n\n\n\nReligious anti-Judaism, which became racial anti-Semitism, began long before Luther, stretching all the way back to the Gospels themselves. It is not just that Jews are labelled as Christ’s killers in the Passion narratives, but that Jesus is fully portrayed throughout the texts as fiercely opposed to his own Jewish people. (“He came unto His own and His own received him not,” John 1:11 says.) If Jesus was merciful, Jews were condemning; if Jesus was egalitarian, Jews were hierarchical; if Jesus was generous, Jews were greedy. Soon enough, Christians imagined that Jesus had never really been Jewish to begin with. Never mind that this was a terrible mistake of memory, that he was a faithful, law-observing, Shema-proclaiming Jew to the end, and that, John’s words notwithstanding, the only ones to receive Jesus in his lifetime were Jews. The imagined conflict persisted, and it informed the structure of Christian theology—church against synagogue, New Testament against Old, Christian god of mercy against Jewish god of judgment. Down through the centuries, this positive-negative bipolarity formed the twin pillars of European consciousness, and, whenever the social equilibrium shook, Jews were targeted. When the targeting reached its genocidal peak, in the twentieth century, the old hatred was exposed once and for all.\n\n\n\nWell, not quite for all. The Holocaust was a world-historic epiphany, but not to the Trump Administration, which last month erased the Holocaust’s most salient feature by deliberately omitting any reference to Jews from the White House’s [official statement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/27/statement-president-international-holocaust-remembrance-day) on International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Trump’s generalizing in that statement—“the victims, survivors, heroes”—wholly ignored the fact that Hitler’s industrialized death machine was created expressly to eliminate one particular people. To neglect that purpose is to restrict responsibility for the broad civilizational crime, with roots in the religious anti-Judaism of the Christian Church, to a small gang of Nazi thugs, as if no one else were guilty. Both the neglecting and the restricting are forms of Holocaust denial.\n\n\n\nIf it is too much for Trump to grasp anti-Semitism as the bug in the software of the West, it is not likely that he will see how his own Islamophobia comes from the same malicious code. When Christendom launched the Crusades, the holy wars that shaped Europe, in the eleventh century, Jews were the paradigmatic enemy inside (the infidel near at hand), and Muslims became the defining enemy outside (the infidel far away). Little wonder, then, that the First Crusade coincided with some of the earliest German pogroms, known as the Rhineland massacres. Within a few hundred years, the Spanish Inquisition had instituted its blood-purity laws, which lumped Muslims and Jews together in a new category of biological inferiority. In 1492 and 1502, first Jews and then Muslims were declared personae non gratae in Spain, facing forced conversion, expulsion, or death. The invention of racism in Europe, in other words, aligned neatly with the discovery of the New World and the advent of colonialism. Genocide and slavery followed.\n\n\n\nIslamophobia is thus, to use the phrase that Edward Said applied to Orientalism, “a strange secret sharer of Western anti-Semitism.” This hidden alignment was particularly discernible in the ease with which the Cold War, with its ubiquitous, if subliminal, anti-Semitism, morphed into the clash of civilizations, with jihadists replacing Reds as figments of the American nightmare. Trump no doubt regards himself as an American original, but he is only the latest ringmaster of this binary circus. In fact, our temperamental President is bigotry’s cliché. Even the cult of white supremacy on which his movement depends has its origins, too, in the positive-negative structure of the Western imagination, a structure erected in the first place to keep Jews in their place. It may offend Donald Trump to be linked to an ancient current, but while his arrival, with all its mayhem, is an unprecedented crime against democratic values, it is also evidence of the deeper disorder from which our culture has yet to recover.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-donald-trump-doesnt-understand-about-anti-semitism","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ccb397f5b30646d065a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Anti-Semitism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"anti-semitism"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1ccc41e4c73c088d77ee","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Holocaust","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"holocaust"},{"id":"5c2e1ccc4a08312cd3aa6ca8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Islamophobia","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"islamophobia"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8b4da97f12ef9160ae6","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/james-carroll","email":"","name":"James Carroll","socialMedia":[],"title":"James Carroll is the author of twenty books, including, most recently, the novel “[The Cloister](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071GJBSFP/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1).”"}]},"dek":"","hed":"What Donald Trump Doesn’t Understand About Anti-Semitism","inlineEmbeds":[],"issueDate":"","ledeCaption":"","modifiedAt":"2018-11-02T22:33:43.336Z","photos":{"tout":[{"id":"59097e7d019dfc3494ea3cff","modelName":"photo","collection":"photos","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":2000,"height":1316,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/tny-services/production/2017/05/03/59097e7d019dfc3494ea3cfe_Carroll-WhatDonaldTrumpDoesntUnderstandAboutAnti-Semitism.jpg"}},"caption":"Hatred of Jews, like hatred of Muslims, is embedded more deeply in the Western consciousness than President Trump seems to understand.","altText":"Photograph of Donald Trump in a blue jacket and red tie","credit":"PHOTOGRAPH BY OLIVIER DOULIERY / GETTY","filename":"Carroll-WhatDonaldTrumpDoesntUnderstandAboutAnti-Semitism.jpg","revision":4,"tags":[],"title":"carroll-whatdonaldtrumpdoesntunderstandaboutanti-semitism","notes":"_wordpress_id:3317823","variants":{}}]},"promoDek":"","promoHed":"","pubDate":"2017-02-23T16:55:38.000Z","related":[],"rubric":"","seoDescription":"James Carroll on Donald Trump, who grudgingly acknowledged bomb threats against U.S. Jewish institutions and omitted Jews from a Holocaust Day statement.","seoTitle":"What Donald Trump Doesn’t Understand About Anti-Semitism","socialDescription":"Hatred of Jews, like hatred of Muslims, is embedded more deeply in the Western consciousness than the President seems to understand.","socialTitle":"What Donald Trump Doesn’t Understand About Anti-Semitism","subChannel":"","tags":["Anti-Semitism","Donald Trump","Holocaust","Islamophobia","_wordpress_id:3317671"],"template":"standard","url":"/news/news-desk/what-donald-trump-doesnt-understand-about-anti-semitism","videos":{}},{"id":"5deae990e3c43e0009599e0f","modelName":"cnevideo","collection":"cnevideos","categories":["News"],"channel":"News","cneId":"5de53e9038d0696a4c999d62","credit":"","dek":"After six months of unrest, anti-Beijing protesters are increasingly unwilling to compromise.
