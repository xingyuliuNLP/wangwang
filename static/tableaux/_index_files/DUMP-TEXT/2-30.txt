US-China Trade War

   The United States and China have a long history of economic rivalry.
   But since 2017, the Trump administration’s challenges to China’s
   business activities and subsequent US and retaliatory tariffs by China,
   and other actions, have spiraled into a full blown economic and trade
   war. As a result of these moves and their related threats, the Chinese
   and US economies are in danger of decoupling. Their mutual distrust
   poses a grave danger to global economic health.
