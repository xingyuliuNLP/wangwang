Why Trade Wars Are Inevitable

Trump’s trade wars aren’t just about him or China—but global economic
imbalances that the next U.S. administration will still have to address.


    By Michael Pettis

   Even as U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping
   announce and then cancel tariffs in a seemingly endless back-and-forth,
   it is a mistake to view the ongoing trade dispute as simply a spat
   between the two. It is not a Trump-Xi fight or even mainly a U.S.-China
   one.

   In fact, when it comes to creating global trade imbalances, China is
   not the only—or even the worst—offender. Its current account surplus is
   no longer the world’s largest; the most recent data suggests China’s
   annualized surplus stands at about $130 billion, significantly smaller
   than Japan’s (roughly $180 billion) and Germany’s (roughly $280
   billion).

   The real problem is that, over the past two decades, it has become
   increasingly difficult for the world to fix its massive trade
   imbalances; the very mechanisms that created them also make them harder
   to absorb. That is because trade surpluses and deficits are mainly the
   result of domestic savings surpluses and deficits, which are themselves
   a result of domestic income inequality. Until such inequality is
   substantially reversed, high-saving countries will continue to use
   trade as a way to pass the effects of their distortions onto other
   nations, such as the United States. This makes global trade conflict
   nearly inevitable—regardless of who sits in the Oval Office. For the
   United States, the only way out may be reconsidering how willing it is
   to absorb everyone else’s excesses.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Contrary to conventional wisdom, today’s trade surpluses are not the
   result of exceptional manufacturing efficiency or unusually
   hard-working and high-saving workforces. In fact, the household savings
   rate in Japan, the country with the world’s second-largest trade
   surplus, has been roughly zero for the past 15 years. Instead, in
   countries such as Germany, Japan, and South Korea, large trade
   surpluses were the natural consequence of policies that, in the name of
   competitiveness, effectively lowered citizens’ purchasing power for the
   benefit of the banking, business, and political elite—and the companies
   they controlled.

   Because its imbalances are so extreme, China is the most obvious case
   in point. By definition, a current account surplus is equal to an
   excess of domestic production over domestic spending on consumption and
   investment. With the highest investment rate in the world, perhaps in
   history, China ought to be running a current account deficit. However,
   because China’s consumption rate is so low, the value of everything
   China produces still eclipses the value of everything China consumes or
   invests domestically. To offload the excess income, it runs a trade
   surplus and invests in financial assets abroad.

   For a long time, observers such as Kishore Mahbubani, the former dean
   of the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public
   Policy, pinned China’s low consumption rate on Asian values that
   supposedly prioritized hard work and saving. That explanation is wrong.
   It confuses household savings with national savings, and while the
   Chinese are indeed hard workers, so are workers everywhere. China’s
   extremely high national savings rate, like that of all the major
   surplus countries, is not driven by the thrift of ordinary households
   but by the fact that the country’s workers and retirees earn a
   disproportionately low share of national income, which diminishes their
   purchasing power.

   During the past two decades, the share of Chinese income earned by
   Chinese households has been the lowest of any country in modern
   history.

   In fact, during the past two decades, the share of Chinese income
   earned by Chinese households has been the lowest of any country in
   modern history. That means that Chinese workers can consume only a
   small share of what they produce.

   The corollary is that an unusually high share of income goes to Chinese
   businesses and to local governments—largely a result of direct and
   hidden subsidies for production that are paid for by ordinary
   households. Beyond sluggish wage growth relative to productivity
   growth, these hidden subsidies include an artificially depressed
   exchange rate, lax environmental regulations, and, most importantly,
   negative real interest rates that have the effect of transferring
   income from household savers to subsidize the borrowing of state-owned
   enterprises and local governments. Rather than being spent on new goods
   and services, the resulting profits are invested in financial assets
   abroad. Trade surpluses are the inevitable consequences.

   China is not unique. For different reasons, Germany has also been a
   model of wage suppression to the benefit of business profits. Since the
   Hartz labor reforms of the early 2000s, suppressed wage growth has led
   to rising income inequality and has boosted the relative share of
   business profits, both of which automatically forced up the country’s
   savings rate and shifted Germany from a country with a small current
   account deficit to the nation with the largest surplus in the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Chinese and German workers’ woes may seem like primarily domestic
   problems, but in a globalized world, distortions in the way income is
   distributed in one country can be transmitted to others through trade.
   That matters especially to the United States, which plays a unique role
   in meeting the financial needs of the rest of the world.

   About half of the world’s excess savings tend to end up in the United
   States.

   Because the U.S. economy is the world’s largest and most diversified,
   and supports the most flexible and best-governed financial markets in
   the world, it has been the natural home for individuals, businesses,
   and governments looking to store wealth abroad that they cannot or will
   not invest at home. About half of the world’s excess savings tend to
   end up in the United States, with another quarter flowing to other
   economies with similarly open and sophisticated financial markets (such
   as the United Kingdom).

   The United States, in other words, for decades has been a net importer
   of foreign capital, not because it needs foreign capital but rather
   because foreigners need somewhere to stash their savings. But
   inevitably that also means the United States has had to run trade
   deficits that have persisted for decades. From a net exporter in the
   1950s and 1960s—when the United States shipped food, manufactured
   products, and capital to the rest of the world’s major economies, whose
   productive capacity had been destroyed by two world wars—by the 1970s
   the balance had started to shift.

   By then, the advanced economies had been largely rebuilt, and the world
   was no longer short of productive capacity. On the contrary, it now
   needed additional demand to absorb all the goods and services being
   provided by the rebuilt economies of countries like Germany and Japan.
   As the American consumer became key, the U.S. trade surplus, through
   which it shipped savings to a world desperately short of investment,
   was transformed into a seemingly permanent U.S. trade deficit.

   In this globalized system, rising income inequality is both the cause
   and a consequence of international trade competition.

   Trade theory tells us that these kinds of imbalances cannot persist
   indefinitely. Usually, automatic adjustments—including rising consumer
   prices, strengthening currencies, and soaring asset values for surplus
   countries and the reverse for deficit countries—eventually eliminate
   deficits and surpluses. The fact that certain countries have
   nonetheless run surpluses for decades, while others have run deficits,
   is evidence that the global trading system is not working as it is
   supposed to.

   There is a cost to this failure. Surplus countries’ ability to export
   their excess savings and production abroad sharply reduces the pressure
   on them to rebalance income at home. What is more, in the race for
   competitiveness with surplus countries, deficit countries must also
   allow, or even encourage, downward pressure on their own wages. In this
   globalized system, rising income inequality is both the cause and a
   consequence of international trade competition.
     __________________________________________________________________

   The question, of course, is what a U.S. president should do. In
   standard economic theory, the financial inflows from the rest of the
   world should have added to Americans’ own savings and led to higher
   levels of domestic investment. But with U.S. financial markets already
   flush with capital (offered at the lowest rates in history), and
   American businesses sitting on piles of unused cash, that is not what
   happened. Instead, overall spending outpaced production, and American
   savings declined. This, too, was inevitable: If foreign capital inflows
   do not cause investment to rise—as was clearly the case in the United
   States—they must cause savings to decline.

   Put another way, foreign savings displaced domestic U.S. savings. This
   happens in countless ways. For example, foreign capital inflows can bid
   up the prices of stocks and real estate, making consumers feel richer
   and encouraging them to spend more. Local banks, responding to a glut
   of cash, can lower lending standards to domestic borrowers in order to
   increase credit. Infusions of foreign capital can cause the dollar to
   appreciate, which encourages spending on foreign imports at the expense
   of domestic production. Factories that can no longer compete can fire
   workers, who begin to tap into their rainy day funds or borrow. The
   government may expand the fiscal deficit to counter the economic
   slowdown.

   Put together, these actions drive down U.S. savings. Indeed, the
   widespread belief that persistently low savings over the past four
   decades reflected spendthrift American habits turns out to have been
   wrong. The United States does not import capital because it has a low
   savings rate—it has a low savings rate because it is forced to absorb
   imported capital.

   The trade war with China ultimately has little to do with Trump’s
   personal animosities or reelection strategy.

   This was not as much of a problem several decades ago, when the U.S.
   economy was much larger relative to the others in its trade orbit.
   During the Cold War, meanwhile, there was added incentive to fill this
   role because it gave the country increased geopolitical leverage.
   However, as the size of the U.S. economy shrank relative to those of
   its trading partners, the cost of playing the balancer rose, and it was
   always only a question of time before the country would no longer be
   able or willing to play its traditional role.

   Once the United States was unable to continue absorbing so much of the
   world’s excess savings, the global system risked coming to a chaotic
   stop: Because no other country was large enough to play this role—and
   no country wanted to—there was no replacement. Trade conflict was
   inevitable. That is why the trade war with China ultimately has little
   to do with Trump’s personal animosities or reelection strategy. It
   simply represents the most visible part of a much deeper global
   imbalance.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Today’s trade war is not really a conflict between the United States
   and China as countries, nor is it even a broader conflict between
   deficit countries and surplus countries. Rather, it is a conflict
   between economic sectors. Bankers and owners of capital in both the
   surplus and the deficit countries have benefited from suppressed wages,
   rising profits, and increased mobility of international capital.
   Workers in the surplus countries paid for the imbalances in the form of
   lower incomes and depreciated currencies. Workers in the deficit
   countries paid for the imbalances in the form of higher unemployment
   and rising debt. Reversing inequality and other distortions in income
   distribution in both the surplus and the deficit countries is therefore
   the only durable way to end the trade war.

   In the long run, future U.S. administrations will have to tackle income
   inequality either through tax reform or by tilting the playing field in
   favor of workers and the middle class—for example by reducing the costs
   of health and education, improving social infrastructure, raising
   minimum wages, or even strengthening labor unions. But before they can
   do that, they will have to fix the American role in the global
   imbalances by making it more difficult for foreigners to dump excess
   savings into U.S. financial markets. That could take many forms, but by
   far the most efficient would be a one-off entry tax on foreign capital
   inflows. Such a tax would eliminate the current account deficit by
   addressing it at its origin in the capital account surplus. It would
   have the additional benefit of forcing the cost of adjustment onto
   banks and financial speculators, unlike tariffs, which force the cost
   onto businesses and consumers.

   In the long run, future U.S. administrations will have to tackle income
   inequality either through tax reform or by tilting the playing field in
   favor of workers and the middle class.

   The alternative is ugly. As the British economist John A. Hobson argued
   in 1902, the economic driver of European imperialism at the end of the
   19th century was extreme inequality that reduced domestic spending and
   lowered the returns on financial assets invested at home. Europe’s
   capitalists needed to find places to dump their excess savings and
   production. They did so by force, securing export markets abroad and
   guaranteeing returns on high-interest loans with armies and gunboats.
   That ended in imperialist conflict and, ultimately, war.

   Less than three decades later, the cycle repeated. In the 1920s, a new
   wave of globalized trade and capital flows coincided with soaring
   income inequality and rising debt. The party came to a halt between
   1929 and 1931 and was followed by a vicious trade competition that also
   ended in war. In each case, a conflict between economic sectors—one in
   which banks and the owners of capital were able to benefit at the
   expense of the rest—was represented as a conflict between countries. It
   wasn’t a trade war then, and it isn’t now. Only when U.S. policymakers
   realize as much—and get ready to tackle income inequality—will they be
   able to head off the worst of the consequences.
