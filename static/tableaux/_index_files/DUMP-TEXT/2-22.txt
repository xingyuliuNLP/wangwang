   China’s manufacturing sector slowed for the sixth month in a row in
   October, and by more than expected, as the tit-for-tat trade war with
   the US and weaker consumer demand dampened activity in the world’s
   second-largest economy.

   Industrial production, the main engine of the Chinese economy, grew at
   annual rate of 4.7% in October, down from 5.8% in the previous month,
   according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

   The slump mirrored a drop in retail sales growth back to a near 16-year
   trough and the weakest growth in investment in new plant and machinery
   on record.

   Analysts said uncertainty about a possible pact between Beijing and
   Washington over a “first stage” trade deal dampened business and
   consumer confidence.

   This week Donald Trump said he would increase tariffs on Chinese
   imports unless Beijing agreed to a broad set of demands that would open
   its domestic markets to US competition.

   The Hong Kong protests were also discouraging investment and hitting
   retail sales. The territory’s Hang Seng index dropped for the seventh
   day, by a further 1%, though the the Shanghai composite index remained
   flat.

   China was hit by a slowdown in GDP growth to 6% in the third quarter,
   from 6.2% in the second quarter, its lowest level in 30 years. Analysts
   said the latest data pointed to a further slowdown in growth in the
   fourth quarter.

   Sophie Altermatt, an economic researcher at the private bank Julius
   Baer, said: “The disappointing October activity data suggests a further
   slowdown in the fourth quarter cannot be avoided.”

   Fixed-asset investment, a key driver of economic growth, rose 5.2% from
   January to October, against expected growth of 5.4% and the weakest
   pace since records began in 1996.

   Infrastructure investment rose 4.2% in the first 10 months, slowing
   from a 4.5% gain between January and September, while retail sales
   increased by 7.2% year-on-year in October, missing expected growth of
   7.9% and matching the more than 16-year low hit in April.

   China’s steel output fell to a seven-month low in October, while the
   cement production contracted for the first time in more than a year.
   Martin Lynge Rasmussen, the China economist at Capital Economics, said
   a minor first-stage deal with the US was unlikely to resolve the trade
   dispute and would merely allow the focus to shift to the more
   intractable issues that could lead to the talks breaking down.

   Meanwhile, Germany narrowly avoided a recession after the economy grew
   by 0.1% in the third quarter. It followed a second-quarter fall in GDP
   of 0.2%, revised down from a previous estimate that suggested the
   economy had contracted over the period by 0.1%.

   Timo Wollmershäuser, the head of economic forecasting at the German
   business lobby group, the Ifo, said the turnaround was mainly
   attributable to industry.

   Analysts had feared Europe’s largest economy was heading for a second
   quarter of negative growth, the technical definition of a recession.

   German businesses have spent the past year coping with sharply
   declining sales by working through backlogs of work, theIfo said, and
   factories were now running in line with long-term trends.

   “Although this sector is still in recession, the rate of decline in
   production has slowed down. A major contributing factor is that goods
   exports are on the upswing again after plummeting in the previous
   quarter,” Wollmershäuser said.

   “One reason for this may be that the mood in the manufacturing sector
   in the export markets has improved again since the middle of the year,
   especially in emerging economies.”

   Household finances had remained in robust shape despite a slowdown in
   employment growth, he said, with private households recording high
   levels of income growth.

   “Alongside an appreciable rise in collective wages, state transfer
   payments such as pensions and child benefit also increased in the
   middle of the year. In addition, mortgage interest rates fell sharply
   once again in the course of the year, and the granting of housing loans
   continued to gain momentum,” Wollmershäuser said.
