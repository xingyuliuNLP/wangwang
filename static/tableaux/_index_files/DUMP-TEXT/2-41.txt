What Is a Trade War?

   A trade war happens when one country retaliates against another by
   raising import tariffs or placing other restrictions on the opposing
   country's imports. A tariff is a tax or duty imposed on the goods
   imported into a nation. In a global economy, a trade war can become
   very damaging to the consumers and businesses of both nations, and the
   contagion can grow to affect many aspects of both economies.

   Trade wars are a side effect of protectionism, which are government
   actions and policies that restrict international trade. A country will
   generally undertake protectionist actions with the intent of shielding
   domestic businesses and jobs from foreign competition. Protectionism is
   also a method used to balance trade deficits. A trade deficit happens
   when a country's imports exceed the amounts of its exports.

Key Takeaways

     * A trade war happens when one country raises tariffs on another
       country's imports in response to increased tariffs from the first
       country.
     * Trade wars are a side effect of protectionist policies.
     * Trade wars are controversial.
     * Advocates say trade wars protect national interests and provide
       advantages to domestic businesses.
     * Critics of trade wars claim they ultimately hurt local companies,
       consumers, and the economy.

The Basics of a Trade War

   Trade wars can commence if one country perceives a competitor nation
   has unfair trading practices. Domestic trade unions or industry
   lobbyists can place pressure on politicians to make imported goods less
   attractive to consumers, pushing international policy toward a trade
   war. Also, trade wars are often a result of a misunderstanding of the
   widespread benefits of free trade.

   A trade war that begins in one sector can grow to affect other sectors.
   Likewise, a trade war that begins between two countries can affect
   other countries not initially involved in the trade war. As noted
   above, this import tit-for-tat battle can result from a protectionist
   penchant.

   A trade war is distinct from other actions taken to control imports and
   exports, such as sanctions. Instead, the war has detrimental effects on
   the trading relationship between two countries in that its goals are
   related specifically to trade. Sanctions, for example, may also have
   philanthropic goals.

   In addition to tariffs, protectionist policies can be implemented by
   placing a cap on import quotas, setting clear product standards, or
   implementing government subsidies for processes to deter outsourcing.

Brief History of Trade Wars

   Trade wars are not an invention of modern society. Such battles have
   been going on for as long as nations have conducted trades with one
   another. Colonial powers fought with each other over the rights to
   trade exclusively with overseas colonies in the 17th century.

   The British Empire has a long history of such trade battles. An example
   can be seen in the opium wars of the 19th century with China. The
   British had been sending Indian-produced opium into China for years
   when the Chinese emperor decreed it to be illegal. Attempts to settle
   the conflict failed, and the emperor eventually sent troops to
   confiscate the drugs. However, the might of the British navy prevailed,
   and China conceded additional entry of foreign trade into the nation.

   In 1930, the U.S. enacted the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act raising tariffs
   to protect American farmers from European agricultural products. This
   Act increased the already hefty import duties to almost 40%. In
   response, several nations retaliated against the U.S. imposing their
   own higher tariffs, and global trade declined worldwide. As America
   entered the Great Depression, President Roosevelt began to pass several
   acts to reduce trade barriers, including the North American Free Trade
   Agreement (NAFTA).

   Beginning in January 2018, President Donald Trump started the
   imposition of a series of tariffs on everything from steel and aluminum
   to solar panels and washing machines. These duties impacted goods from
   the European Union (EU) and Canada as well as China and Mexico. Canada
   imposed a series of temporary duties on American steel and other
   products. The EU also imposed tariffs on American agricultural imports
   and other products including Harley Davidson motorcycles.

   By May 2019 tariffs on Chinese imports impacted nearly US$200 billion
   of imports. As with all trade wars, China retaliated and imposed stiff
   duties on American imports. According to a report from CNBC, a study by
   the International Monetary Fund (IMF) shows that the U.S. importers of
   the goods have primarily shouldered the cost of the imposed tariffs on
   Chinese goods. Many believe these costs will, in turn, be passed on to
   the American consumer in the form of higher product prices.

The Pros and Cons of a Trade War

   The advantages and disadvantages of trade wars in particular and
   protectionism, in general, are the subjects of fierce and ongoing
   debate.

   Proponents of protectionism argue that well-crafted policies provide
   competitive advantages. By blocking or discouraging imports, protective
   policies throw more business toward the domestic producers, which
   ultimately creates more American employment. These policies also serve
   to overcome a trade deficit. Further, proponents believe that painful
   tariffs and trade wars may also be the only effective way to deal with
   a nation that behaves unfairly or unethically in its trading policies.

Pros

     * Protects domestic companies from unfair competition
     * Increases demand for domestic goods
     * Promotes local job growth
     * Improves trade deficits
     * Punishes nation with unethical trade policies

Cons

     * Increases costs and induces inflation
     * Causes marketplace shortages, reduces choice
     * Discourages trade
     * Slows economic growth
     * Hurts diplomatic relations, cultural exchange

   Critics argue that protectionism often hurts the people it is intended
   to protect long-term by choking off markets and slowing economic growth
   and cultural exchange. Consumers may begin to have less choice in the
   marketplace. They may even face shortages if there is no ready domestic
   substitute for the imported goods that tariffs have impacted or
   eliminated. Having to pay more for raw materials hurts manufacturers'
   profit margins. As a result, trade wars can lead to price
   increases—with manufactured goods, in particular, becoming more
   expensive—sparking inflation in the local economy overall.

Real World Example of a Trade War

   While running for President in 2016, President Donald Trump expressed
   his disdain for many current trade agreements, promising to bring
   manufacturing jobs back to the United States from other nations where
   they have been outsourced, such as China and India. After his election,
   he embarked on a protectionist campaign. President Trump also
   threatened to pull the U.S. out of the World Trade Organization (WTO),
   an impartial, international entity that regulates and arbitrates trade
   among the 164 countries that belong to it.

   In early 2018, President Trump stepped up his efforts, particularly
   against China, threatening a big fine over alleged intellectual
   property (IP) theft and significant tariffs on $500 billion worth of
   Chinese products such as steel and soy products. The Chinese retaliated
   with a 25% tax on over 100 U.S. products.

   Throughout the year, the two nations continued to threaten each other,
   releasing lists of proposed tariffs on various goods. In September, the
   U.S. implemented 10% tariffs. Although China responded with tariffs of
   its own, the American duties did have an impact on the Chinese economy,
   hurting manufacturers and causing a slowdown.

   In December, each nation agreed to halt imposing any new taxes. The
   tariff war cease-fire continued into 2019. In the spring, China and the
   U.S. seemed on the verge of a trade agreement.

   However, at the beginning of May, literally less than a week before
   final talks were slated to begin, Chinese officials took a new hard
   line in negotiations, refusing to make changes in their
   company-subsidizing laws and insisting on the lifting of the current
   tariffs. Angered by this apparent backtracking, the president doubled
   down, announcing May 5 that he was going to increase tariffs from 10%
   to 25% on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, as of May 10. He may
   have felt emboldened by the fact that the U.S. trade deficit with China
   had fallen to its lowest level in 2014.

   China halted all imports of farm products by state-owned firms in
   retaliation. The Asian nation's central bank also weakened the yuan
   above the seven per dollar reference rate for the first time in over a
   decade, leading to concerns about a currency war.

   The next round of negotiations is meant to take place in September, but
   Trump has said they may not happen.
