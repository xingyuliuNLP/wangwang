   A trade war is when a nation imposes tariffs or quotas on imports and
   foreign countries retaliate with similar forms of trade protectionism.
   As it escalates, a trade war reduces international trade.

   A trade war starts when a nation attempts to protect its domestic
   industry and create jobs. In the short run, it may work. Tariffs are
   supposed to give a competitive advantage to domestic producers of that
   product. Their prices would be lower by comparison. As a result, they
   would receive more orders from local customers. As their businesses
   grow, they would add jobs.

   But in the long run, a trade war costs jobs. It depresses economic
   growth for all countries involved. It also triggers inflation when
   tariffs increase the prices of imports.

   The 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff was a trade war that worsened the Great
   Depression. It increased 900 import tariffs by an average of 40% to
   48%.

   Smoot-Hawley was designed to support U.S. farmers who had been ravaged
   by the Dust Bowl. But it also raised food prices for Americans who were
   already suffering from the Great Depression. Other countries retaliated
   with their own tariffs. The trade war reduced international trade by
   65%. It turned a recession into a depression and contributed to the
   start of World War II.

Trump's Trade Wars

   President Donald Trump wants to reduce the $621 billion U.S. trade
   deficit. It’s been the world’s largest since 1975. Reducing the deficit
   is part of Trump’s strategy to create more jobs.

   Most of the U.S. deficit results from American enthusiasm for imported
   consumer products and automobiles. In 2018, the United States imported
   $648 billion in drugs, televisions, clothing, and other household
   items. It only exported $206 billion of these consumer goods. That
   alone added $442 billion to the deficit. America imported $372 billion
   worth of automobiles and parts, while only exporting $159 billion. That
   added another $214 billion to the trade deficit.

   In early 2018, Trump said, "Trade wars are good and easy to win."﻿﻿ He
   has initiated three: a global tariff on steel, a tariff on European
   autos, and tariffs on Chinese imports. After Trump’s announcement,
   global stock markets tumbled in fear of a trade war between the world's
   three largest economies. In late 2018, several U.S. companies formed
   "Tariffs Hurt the Heartland.”﻿﻿ They are hurt by the rising costs of
   imported materials.﻿﻿

   The Federal Reserve estimates Trump's tariffs are costing the average
   American household $1,245 a year.﻿﻿ This includes higher prices and
   lost economic growth.

   In August 2019, Goldman Sachs warned that the trade war could spark a
   recession.﻿﻿ It's already lowered gross domestic product by 0.6%.

   Farmers suffer from retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and Europe on
   their exports. In the farm belt of Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin,
   bankruptcies have risen to their highest level in a decade.﻿﻿ In 2017,
   those states produced half of all U.S. food. Nationally, farmers’
   income fell by $11.8 billion between January and March 2019. That’s the
   most since 2016.﻿﻿

   On May 23, 2019, Trump gave farmers $16 billion in aid to partially
   compensate for their losses.﻿﻿ He gave them $12 billion in 2018.

   Other countries are forming trade agreements that exclude the United
   States. In April 2018, the EU upgraded its agreement with Mexico,
   removing almost all tariffs.﻿﻿ In July 2018, the EU signed an agreement
   with Japan that reduces or ends tariffs on almost all goods.﻿﻿ It's the
   largest bilateral trade agreement in existence, covering $152 billion
   in goods.

Steel Tariffs

   On March 8, 2018, Trump administration announced a 25% tariff on steel
   and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports.﻿﻿ It said that dependence on
   imported metals threatens America’s ability to make weapons.﻿﻿
   The Aerospace Industry Council said Trump's tariffs would raise the
   military’s costs instead.﻿﻿

   The U.S. Congress is the only body authorized to impose tariffs. But in
   1962, it allowed the president to curb imports that threatened national
   security.﻿﻿ The World Trade Organization can't adjudicate trade
   disputes that involve security.

   America is the world's largest steel importer, thanks to users like
   automakers.﻿﻿ Steel importers employ 6.5 million workers compared to
   147,000 workers in the U.S. steel industry. Tariffs lowered
   second-quarter profits for the big three automakers.﻿﻿ To satisfy
   shareholders, they passed those costs onto consumers. Costs from
   tariffs have already outweighed any benefits of Trump's tax plan.﻿﻿

   Eight countries filed complaints with the World Trade Organization.﻿﻿
   Six of them - Canada, India, and Mexico, the European Union, Norway,
   and Switzerland - pointed out they are allies. The other two
   complainants are China and Russia.

   On March 26, 2018, Trump exempted South Korea, Argentina, Australia,
   and Brazil from the steel tariff.﻿﻿ South Korea agreed to double its
   import quota for U.S. cars. It allowed the United States to keep its
   25% tariff on pickup trucks for an additional 20 years.

   After the June 11, 2018, G7 meeting, Canadian Prime Minister Justin
   Trudeau said Canada would retaliate with tariffs. Mexico announced
   tariffs on flat steel, lamps, and pork products.

   On May 17, 2019, Trump agreed to lift the tariffs in 48 hours on steel
   imports from Canada and Mexico.﻿﻿ In return, they will prevent Chinese
   steel from being shipped from their countries to the United States.

Tariffs Against Mexico

   On June 4, 2019, Trump threatened to impose a 5% tariff on all imports
   from Mexico effective June 10.﻿﻿ He wants the government to reduce the
   number of asylum-seekers presenting themselves at the U.S.-Mexico
   border. He promised to raise the tariff to 25% if needed to force
   Mexico to act.

   The tariff would be in violation of NAFTA. Trump said he can override
   the trade agreement by declaring a national emergency. Republicans, who
   have supported the president, are threatening to oppose this latest
   action.

U.S. - China Trade War Major Events Timeline

   By far, the largest U.S. trade deficit by country is with China. In
   2018, the U.S. trade deficit with China was $419 billion. The United
   States imported $540 billion, primarily in computers, cell phones, and
   apparel. Much of this is manufactured in China by U.S. companies but is
   still considered imports. The U.S. companies exported $120 billion to
   China. Most of this was commercial aircraft, soybeans, and autos.

   In addition to reducing the trade deficit, Trump wants to limit U.S.
   technology transfers to Chinese companies. China requires foreign
   companies who want to sell products in China to share their trade
   secrets. The administration has also asked China to stop subsidizing
   the 10 industries prioritized in its "Made in China 2025" plan.﻿﻿ These
   include robotics, aerospace, and software. China also plans to be the
   world's primary artificial intelligence center by 2030. China is
   unlikely to agree to those demands.

   The Trump administration has imposed three tariffs on a total of $250
   billion in Chinese imports. The Federal Reserve estimated these tariffs
   cost the average household $419 per year.﻿﻿

   On May 20, 2019, Trump imposed a fourth tariff.﻿﻿ He raised tariffs to
   25% on $200 billion worth of goods. The Fed estimated it would cost the
   average household $831 a year. Trump is increasing the pressure on
   trade talks that are underway.

   Trump threatened to expand that tariff to an additional $325 billion of
   Chinese imports.﻿﻿ That would raise prices on basically all Chinese
   imports. On June 29, 2019, Trump delayed the proposed tariffs to
   encourage renewed trade talks with China.﻿﻿

   On June 1, 2019, China retaliated with a 25% tariff on $60 billion of
   U.S. goods.﻿﻿ Some investors are also worried China may sell some of
   its $1.1 trillion in U.S. debt.﻿﻿ That would send interest rates higher
   and slow the U.S. economy.

   On August 13, 2019, Trump threatened a 10% tariff on Chinese
   electronics and clothing.﻿﻿ The tariff would start on December 15 to
   limit damage on the holiday shopping season. But the tariff would begin
   on September 1 on other items.

Previous Tariffs

   On January 22, 2018, President Trump imposed tariffs and quotas on
   imported Chinese solar panels and washing machines.﻿﻿ China is a world
   leader in solar equipment manufacturing.

   On March 8, 2018, Trump asked China to develop a plan to reduce the
   trade deficit by $100 billion.﻿﻿ China's economic reform plan includes
   reducing its reliance on exports. But it said it can’t stop Americans
   from demanding low-cost Chinese goods.

   On March 22, 2018, the administration announced tariffs on $60 billion
   of Chinese imports.﻿﻿ It said China uses cybertheft, espionage, and
   government pressure to obtain leading-edge technology.﻿﻿ On March 23,
   China announced tariffs on $3 billion of U.S. fruit, pork, recycled
   aluminum, and steel pipes.﻿﻿

   On March 26, 2018, the administration began negotiations with China.﻿﻿
   It asked China to reduce tariffs on U.S. automobiles, import more U.S.
   semiconductors, and grant greater access to its financial sector.

   On April 3, 2018, the administration threatened a 25% tariff on $50
   billion in Chinese electronics, aerospace, and machinery.﻿﻿ On April
   18, China penalized two other U.S. exports: sorghum and Boeing
   airplanes. It targeted industries located in states that supported
   Trump in the 2016 election. It lifted the sorghum tariffs on May 18.﻿﻿

   On May 2, 2018, China canceled all U.S. soybean import
   contracts.﻿﻿ China imported $12 billion in U.S. soybeans to feed pigs,
   its primary meat staple. It replaced U.S. beans with those from Brazil.
   U.S. farmers sold one-half of their crop to China. As that market
   disappeared, it hurt the United States more than China. In July 2018,
   soybean prices hit a 10-year low as analysts predicted oversupply.﻿﻿

   On April 5, 2018, Trump threatened tariffs on $100 billion more of
   Chinese imports.﻿﻿ It would cover just one-third of U.S. imports from
   China. If China retaliated in kind, it would slap levies on all U.S.
   exports to China.

   On April 10, 2018, China announced it would reduce tariffs on imported
   vehicles. But most automakers find it’s cheaper to build in China,
   regardless of tariffs.

   On May 4, 2018, the administration asked China to reduce the trade
   deficit by $200 billion and cut tariffs on U.S. goods by 2020.﻿﻿ It
   asked China to end subsidies to tech companies, stop stealing U.S.
   intellectual property, and become open to more U.S. investment.

   On May 15, 2018, China agreed to allow Qualcomm to acquire NXP. In
   exchange, the United States would remove tariffs on Chinese telecom
   company ZTE. This agreement supports a mercantilist philosophy. It
   promotes specific industries that are important for the leaders'
   political purposes.﻿﻿

   The telecom industry is part of China's growth strategy, which is one
   reason Trump imposed tariffs. The other is that the company violated
   U.S. sanctions against Iran and North Korea. On June 12, the Senate
   blocked Trump's deal.﻿﻿ Many countries see Trump's removal of tariffs
   on ZTE as a weakness they could exploit.﻿﻿ They will redouble efforts
   to find exceptions to Trump's tariffs. Many European countries want to
   avoid U.S. sanctions on Iran. They may threaten tariffs on U.S. imports
   as a bargaining tool.

   On May 21, 2018, China agreed to cut tariffs on U.S. auto imports from
   25% to 15%. It would go into effect July 1.﻿﻿

   On May 29, 2018, the administration said it would target $50 billion in
   imports from China.﻿﻿ It would also restrict Chinese acquisition of
   U.S. technology.

   On July 6, 2018, U.S. tariffs went into effect for $34 billion of
   Chinese imports.﻿﻿ China retaliated with a 40% tariff on U.S. autos.﻿﻿
   Tesla announced it will build a factory in Shanghai to avoid the
   tariff.﻿﻿ China also announced tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports.

   Midwest farmers have been stuck with excess produce and livestock. On
   July 24, 2018, Trump announced he would offer $12 billion in subsidies
   to American farmers.﻿﻿ On August 27, the administration announced a
   $4.7 billion bailout.﻿﻿ Corn growers alone said their costs top $6
   billion.

   On July 11, 2018, the administration announced 10% tariffs on another
   $200 billion of Chinese imports.﻿﻿ They went into effect in
   mid-September 2018, weeks before the 2018 midterm elections.﻿﻿ The U.S.
   also threatened 25% tariffs after January 1, 2019, on a variety of
   consumer goods, including fish, luggage, tires, handbags, furniture,
   apparel, and mattresses.

   China threatened to retaliate by adding tariffs on $60 billion in U.S.
   exports.﻿﻿ In response, Trump threatened to add tariffs until all $500
   billion of Chinese imports are affected. That could have reduced
   economic growth by 0.75 points in 2018.﻿﻿ It might have also threatened
   U.S. shale oil exports. China buys 20% of U.S. oil exports.﻿﻿

   On August 2, 2018, the administration announced a 25% tariff on $16
   billion worth of Chinese goods.﻿﻿ It went into effect on August 23. It
   applied to industrial equipment like tractors, plastic tubes, and
   chemicals. In response, China announced a 25% tariff on $16 billion
   worth of U.S. goods, including autos and coal. It went into effect the
   same day.

   On September 18, 2018, the administration announced tariffs on $200
   billion of Chinese imports.﻿﻿ A 10% tariff would launch on September
   24, 2018. It would increase to 25% on January 1, 2019. The tariffs were
   imposed on 5,745 items.﻿﻿ They encompassed a wide range of electronics,
   food, tools, and housewares.﻿﻿

   On December 1, 2018, President Trump met with China's President Xi
   Jinping at the G-20 Conference.﻿﻿ Trump agreed to delay the 25% tariff
   increase from January 1, 2019, to March 1, 2019.﻿﻿ Negotiators planned
   to cover 142 issues.﻿﻿ These included the protection of intellectual
   property, technology, and cybersecurity, as well as currency,
   agriculture, and energy.

   On December 11, various federal agencies said they would condemn China
   for stealing U.S. trade secrets and technologies.﻿﻿ The Justice
   Department would indict hackers who broke into U.S. networks. Later
   that day, China agreed to roll back some auto tariffs raised earlier
   in.﻿﻿ It also agreed to reinstate some purchases of soybean imports and
   allow U.S. firms greater access to Chinese industries.﻿﻿

   On January 18, 2019, China agreed to increase its purchases of U.S.
   exports and reduce the trade deficit.﻿﻿

   On February 27, 2019, the administration dropped the threat of imposing
   the 25% tariff.﻿﻿ It was originally scheduled to begin January 1, then
   moved to March 1, then dropped.

Causes of U.S. Trade War with China

   U.S. politicians have long threatened a trade war with America's
   largest trading partner in goods.﻿﻿ A trade deficit occurs when exports
   are less than imports.

   In 2017, the United States exported $130 billion to China. The three
   largest export categories are aircraft at $16 billion; soybeans, $12
   billion; and automobiles, $11 billion.﻿﻿ U.S. imports from China were
   $506 billion. Most of it is electronics, clothing, and machinery.

   Half of all Chinese imports are goods used by U.S. manufacturers to
   make other products.﻿﻿ They send raw materials to China for low-cost
   assembly. Once shipped back to the United States, they are considered
   imports. The tariffs raise their costs, forcing them to either raise
   prices or lay off workers.

   An example is salmon caught in Alaska and sent to China for processing,
   then sent back to U.S. grocery shelves.﻿﻿ If Trump imposes tariffs on
   seafood imports, it will raise prices by 25 cents to 50 cents a pound.

   China is the world's No.1 exporter. Its comparative advantage is that
   it can produce consumer goods for lower costs than other countries can.
   China has a lower standard of living, which allows its companies to pay
   lower wages. American companies can't compete with China's low costs,
   so it loses U.S. manufacturing jobs. Americans, of course, want these
   goods for the lowest prices. Most are not willing to pay more for "Made
   in America."

Trade War With the EU

   On March 7, 2018, the EU threatened a 25% tariff on U.S. exports such
   as cranberries, Harley Davidson motorcycles, blue jeans, and bourbon.﻿﻿
   Trump delayed the steel tariff until May 1, 2018.﻿﻿

   On April 21, 2018, the EU upgraded its trade agreement with Mexico.﻿﻿
   Once signed, it will remove tariffs from almost all trade between the
   two areas.

   On May 1, 2018, Trump announced he would delay the steel tariff against
   the EU until June 1, 2018.﻿﻿ He wanted the U.S. ally to cut its 10%
   tariff on U.S. autos. He also asked the EU to set quotas on its steel
   exports.

   But on May 31, 2018, Trump revoked the delay. He imposed the tariff on
   Canada, Mexico, and the EU.﻿﻿ The U.S. Aluminum Association said the
   move will disrupt "supply chains that more than 97% of U.S. aluminum
   industry jobs rely upon.”

   On June 21, Germany proposed to end the EU's 10% tax on U.S. auto
   imports if Trump forgot about imposing a 25% tax on European auto
   imports.﻿﻿ There is already a 25% U.S. tariff on light trucks.﻿﻿

   On June 22, the EU retaliated to the steel tariffs with tariffs on $3.2
   billion of American products.﻿﻿ It targeted imports that will impact
   Trump’s political base. Examples of these taxable imports are bourbon,
   motorcycles, and orange juice.

   On July 17, 2018, the EU signed a trade agreement with Japan.﻿﻿ It
   reduces or ends tariffs on almost all goods. It's the largest bilateral
   trade agreement, covering $152 billion in goods. It will come into
   force in 2019 after ratification.

   On July 25, 2018, the EU and the United States agreed to hold off on
   any new tariffs, reassess the steel and aluminum tariffs, and work
   toward zero tariffs on non-auto industrial goods.﻿﻿ The EU agreed to
   import more U.S. liquefied natural gas and soybeans. That would reduce
   its reliance on Russian LNG and help out American farmers who have lost
   the Chinese market due to the trade war. But Russia's LNG price is much
   lower than America's, so it's unlikely any big changes will be made
   there.

   On April 15, 2019, the Trump administration announced it would impose
   tariffs on $11 billion in European imports.﻿﻿ It wants to force the EU
   to end subsidies for aircraft manufacturer Airbus. The tariffs could
   raise prices on imported cheese, bicycles, and kitchen knives.

How It Affects You

   The trade war has raised the prices of consumer goods that use steel
   and aluminum. Soda and beer suppliers were the first to raise prices.﻿﻿
   Costs have increased on imported clothes hangers, heavy-equipment
   materials, and computer chip and tool makers.

   The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers warned that U.S.-produced
   steel will cost more once cheap foreign imports are eliminated.﻿﻿ The
   move is "threatening the industry’s global competitiveness and
   raising vehicle costs for our customers."

   For example, Mid-Continent Nail in Missouri announced layoffs because
   steel prices became too high for them to remain profitable.﻿﻿
   Harley-Davidson announced it would move some production abroad to avoid
   retaliatory EU tariffs.

   The Maine lobster industry will suffer from Chinese retaliatory tariffs
   on U.S. seafood.﻿﻿ California cheese makers are already seeing their
   markets in China and Mexico disappear due to retaliatory tariffs.﻿﻿
   Wisconsin auto parts manufacturers and the U.S. bourbon industry are
   other industries being punished.﻿﻿ Tariffs have also slowed U.S. timber
   and grain exports, according to The Wall Street Journal.﻿﻿

   In October 2018, several companies forecast how much tariff-related
   costs will hurt in 2019:
     * United Technologies: $200 billion.﻿﻿
     * 3M: $100 million.﻿﻿
     * Honeywell: "hundreds of millions."﻿﻿
     * Ford: $1 billion.﻿﻿

   Foreign tariffs on U.S. exports will make them more expensive. U.S.
   exporters may have to cut costs and lay off workers to remain
   competitively priced. If they fail, they may cuts costs further or even
   go out of business.

   In the long term, trade wars slow economic growth. They create more
   layoffs, not fewer, as foreign countries retaliate. The 12 million U.S.
   workers who owe their jobs to exports could get laid off.

   Consultant Oxford Economics predicted the trade war could cost the
   global economy $800 billion in reduced trade.﻿﻿ That could slow growth
   by 0.4%. It's occurring at the same time that oil prices and interest
   rates are rising.

   Over time, trade wars weaken the protected domestic industry. Without
   foreign competition, companies within the industry don't need to
   innovate. Eventually, the local product would decline in quality
   compared to foreign-made goods.

The Bottom Line

   A trade war may improve a nation’s trade deficit in the short run but
   it could cost warring nations their economic growth in the long term.
   The United States is currently engaged in a trade war with China, the
   EU, Mexico, and Canada. Because of this, the affected countries have
   signed new trade agreements with other countries and have left America
   out of the loop.

   President Trump’s attempts at trade protectionism have already hurt the
   U.S. economy. They raised the prices of automobiles, computer chips,
   soda and beer, and heavy equipment. Companies have cut jobs because the
   cost of production with local materials is prohibitive. U.S. exporters
   of agricultural products, bourbon, cheese, and auto parts are suffering
   as foreign markets disappear under retaliatory tariffs. Trump must
   resolve the trade war soon before it wreaks serious damage on the U.S.
   economy.
