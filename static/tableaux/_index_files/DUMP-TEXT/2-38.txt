   iRobot finds itself in a bind. The Massachusetts-based robotics company
   that makes the Roomba, among other autonomous cleaning devices, saw its
   stock plummet by nearly 20 percent today, after reporting third quarter
   earnings yesterday, as a result of lower sales in August and September.
   But its sales were only lower because it decided to increase prices in
   the US, an ill-fated move that’s hurt the company domestically.

   The culprit? President Trump’s ongoing trade war with China, which
   iRobot’s chairman and CEO, Colin Angle, cited directly as the cause.
   “Despite the severity of US tariffs on robotic vacuum cleaners, and the
   direct and indirect disruptions they are having on US category growth,
   we remain committed to delivering exceptional value to consumers and
   are mobilizing accordingly,” Angle said, according to a report from
   investment and finance blog The Motley Fool.

   This has been coming for a while. In July, The Fool quoted Angle as
   saying that his company “believe[s] that the direct and indirect
   impacts of the ongoing US-China trade war and the recently implemented
   25 percent tariffs are likely to constrain US market segment growth in
   the second half of the year below our expectations at the start of
   2019.” Which is basically what happened. This past quarter, in the US,
   revenue declined 7 percent from this time a year ago. (International
   revenue, however, was up a full 25 percent.)

   "Pity the humble Roomba, a wholly blameless soul"

   After Trump’s tariffs were announced, iRobot decided to offset the
   costs of the tariffs on their products by briefly increasing the price
   of its products, which they quickly rolled back, because those price
   shifts hurt the number of units they sold. The company seems to be
   reevaluating its position, though, and Angle indicated the plan was to
   retrench and invest further in research and development to maintain
   their position as market leader.

   That’s interesting because it means that iRobot’s market share has also
   been negatively impacted by the US-China tariffs. As the Fool reported,
   “it seems clear that the company continues to believe now is a crucial
   time to prioritize maintaining market share via a combination of
   attractive pricing and heavy R&D investments.” The point, in other
   words, is to solidify iRobot’s dominance of the home robotics market.

   Economics is an emotional science, with share prices largely determined
   by “investor confidence” (e.g., how they feel) and squishy guesses
   about what the market might look like in the future. That’s not
   necessarily a bad thing. But it does underscore the real impact that
   Trump’s tariffs are having on the economy: they’re making it materially
   harder for businesses to sell to consumers. Trade wars aren’t easy to
   win, and they have a lot of victims. Pity the humble Roomba, a wholly
   blameless soul.

   All this said: the 20 percent stock drop doesn’t seem to have the Fool
   worried. “If the drop is still holding when my Motley Fool trade
   restrictions are satisfied, I fully intend to add to my position later
   this week,” writes author Steve Symington.
