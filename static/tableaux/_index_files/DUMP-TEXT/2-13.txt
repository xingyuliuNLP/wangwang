US-China trade war is a ‘lose-lose’ situation for them and the world, warn UN
economists

   Economic Development

   The trade tariff spat between China and the United States has been a
   “lose-lose” situation for both countries and the wider world and it is
   likely to deteriorate unless a deal is reached, UN economists said on
   Tuesday.

   According to data from the first six months of the year, most of the
   cost of higher US tariffs on China has been passed down to US consumers
   and firms.

   “US consumers are paying for the tariffs …in terms of higher prices,”
   said Alessandro Nicita, an economist at the UN trade agency, UNCTAD.
   “Not only final consumers like us, but importers of intermediate
   products – firms which import parts and components from China.”

Tariffs ‘cost China $35 billion in first half of 2019’

   But the US-initiated measures – put in place in the middle of last year
   - have also hit the Asian giant, to the tune of $35 billion.

     Our new paper on the trade + trade diversion effects of the US-China
     #tradewars shows that while China feels the pinch, other countries
     are benefiting. US tariffs on China have made other players more
     competitive in the US market, a trade diversion effect.

     — UNCTAD (@UNCTAD) November 5, 2019

   Its firms have seen exports of these targeted products fall by a
   quarter over the same period on average, with other competitors –
   notably Taiwan – picking up some of the slack ($4.2 billion in the
   first half of 2019).

   Other trade winners from the measures include Mexico ($3.5 billion),
   the European Union ($2.7 billion) and Viet Nam ($2.6 billion) and the
   positive effects for them “have increased over time”, UNCTAD said.

   Korea, Canada and India also benefited, with “substantial” gains
   ranging from $0.9 billion to $1.5 billion.

   Other South East Asian countries scooped up the remainder of the
   tariff-induced casualties, UNCTAD said, while noting that African
   countries saw only “minimal” benefits.

   Of the $35 billion Chinese export losses in the US market, about $21
   billion (or 63 per cent) was diverted to these countries and others,
   while the remaining $14 billion was either lost or captured by US
   producers.

Chinese manufacturers bearing costs

   The UN agency also noted that there is early evidence that Chinese
   exporters may have started to bear part of the costs of the tariffs by
   lowering export prices.

   The hardest-hit Chinese manufacturing sector has been computers and
   other office machinery, and communications equipment, where exports
   from China have declined by $15 billion.

   Other areas that have “dropped substantially” include chemicals,
   furniture, precision instruments and electrical machinery, the UNCTAD
   report shows.

   It nonetheless underscored the resilience of Chinese firms, which
   maintained 75 per cent of their exports to the US, despite the
   “substantial” tariffs imposed.

Trade war is a global warning

   “The results of the study serve as a global warning; a lose-lose trade
   war is not only harming the main contenders, it also compromises the
   stability of the global economy and future growth,” said UNCTAD’s
   director of international trade and commodities, Pamela Coke Hamilton.
   “We hope a potential trade agreement between the US and China can
   deescalate trade tensions.”

   While the UNCTAD report does not consider the impact of Chinese tariffs
   on US imports, it suggests that the result is “most likely” to be the
   same: “higher prices for Chinese consumers, losses for US exporters and
   trade gains for other countries”.
