U.S.-China Trade War Talks: America Should Give China Room To 'Fall'

   America has the upper hand in the US-China trade war talks.

   That’s according to a number of China observers, who see a bigger
   chance for China to blink before the US does.

   One of them is Jeff Yastine, senior equities analyst at Banyan Hill
   Publishing.

   “Both have hard reasons to want some kind of a rapprochement on the
   trade impasse,” says  Yastine. “But I give the upper hand to the US
   side as they meet late this week, despite the Trump administration's
   bungling. While China aims to move its economy towards one based on
   consumption, much like the U.S., it's not there yet.”

   Dan North, Chief Economist at Euler Hermes North America, agrees.

   “Tariffs are having a detrimental effect on both economies,” says
   North. “But it appears to be worse for China. And in that sense the
   tariffs may offer leverage in the negotiations. That approach worked in
   the NAFTA 2.0 negotiations.”

   China's Terms of Trade

   Meanwhile, China’s central bank is running out of ammunition to help
   the country’s economy deal with an economic slow-down caused by the
   trade war. “It's worth noting that China's central bank is already in
   stimulus-injection mode,” says Yastine. “It injected $85 billion in a
   single day back in mid-January, which was considered something of a
   record by observers.”

   That isn’t the case with America’s central bank.  “On the other hand,
   the Fed is only just getting around to hinting that it might not raise
   interest rates, or do so as fast as the market expected months ago,” he
   adds.

   In addition, America has the technology advantage, according to
   Yastine.  “I believe the advantage still lies with the US with its
   entrepreneurial, risk-based economy,” he says. “That advantage remains,
   even with China's endemic pilfering of US technology.”

   And he warns investors not to forget that China is a top-down economy.
   “Investors tend to forget that China's economy still has very much of a
   top-down, command-and-control aspect, weighted in massive amounts of
   debt and directed by party apparatchiks in Beijing and the provinces.”

   That means big bets have big rewards and big risks. According to
   Yastine, “when they make the right bets, it can lead to huge fast gains
   in their economic progress. The problem is, when they make the wrong
   bets, it can throw the entire economy off-track for years as whole
   sectors miss out on unexpected turns in technological progress.”


   This means that time is working against China.

   “Every day that passes without a deal is another day where the Chinese
   economy loses ground compared to competitors in the US and allied
   countries,” he concludes.

   Still, America must leave China with some room to “fall.”  Why? To
   allow it to lose the war gracefully, and appease nationalistic
   sentiment at home.
