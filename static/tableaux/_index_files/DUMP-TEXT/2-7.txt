   A trade war is an economic conflict resulting from extreme
   protectionism in which states raise or create tariffs or other trade
   barriers against each other in response to trade barriers created by
   the other party.^[1] Increased protection causes both nations' output
   compositions to move towards their autarky position.^[2]

   Trade wars could be escalated to full conflict between states, as
   evidenced in the Massacre of the Bandanese after alleged violations of
   a new treaty. The First Anglo-Dutch War caused by disputes over trade,
   the war began with English attacks on Dutch merchant shipping, but
   expanded to vast fleet actions. The Second Anglo-Dutch War for control
   over the seas and trade routes, where England tried to end the Dutch
   domination of world trade during a period of intense European
   commercial rivalry. The Fourth Anglo-Dutch War over British and Dutch
   disagreements on the legality and conduct of Dutch trade with Britain's
   enemies in that war. The Shimonoseki Campaign after unrest over the
   shogunate's open-door policy to foreign trade. The First Opium War
   which started after the Qing government blockaded its ports,
   confiscated opium contraband and confined British traders, resulted in
   the dispatch of the British Navy to China and engage the Chinese Navy
   in the Battle of Kowloon. The First Opium War eventually led to the
   British colony of Hong Kong, and the Second Opium War, which arose from
   another trade war with the same underlying causes, expanded the British
   possessions on the island.
