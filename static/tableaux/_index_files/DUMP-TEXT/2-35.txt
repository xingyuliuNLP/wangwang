China and U.S. ‘agree to phased rollback’ of extra trade war tariffs

   It is unlikely that the countries will be able to sign an interim deal
   this month.

   This report is being published by POLITICO as part of a content
   partnership with the South China Morning Post. It first appeared on
   scmp.com on Nov. 7, 2019.

   China and the United States have agreed to remove additional tariffs in
   phases once their leaders sign an interim deal towards ending a costly
   trade war, with both sides still working to wrap up the agreement, the
   Chinese Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday.

   Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said China and the U.S. had extensive and
   serious discussions over the past two weeks to try to end their trade
   war, and the agreement would help stabilize the world economy.

   “In the past two weeks, top negotiators have had serious and
   constructive discussions on resolving issues of core concern. Both
   sides agreed to remove the additional tariffs imposed in phases as
   progress is made on the agreement,” Gao said.

   “If China and the U.S. reach a phase one deal, both sides should roll
   back existing additional tariffs in the same proportion
   simultaneously.”

   He said that both sides could decide how much would be scrapped in the
   first phase based on the content of the agreement.

   “Economic and trade teams from both sides have been in constant
   communication. We hope to resolve our issues of core concern in an
   equal and mutually respectful manner,” he said.

   But Gao said he had no information about where or when an agreement
   would be signed.

   Adding momentum for the trade talks, the General Administration of
   Customs and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said they
   were considering removing restrictions on imports of U.S. poultry.

   Stocks rallied on Thursday, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index climbing
   0.6 percent. European shares and US stock futures also rose and the
   yuan strengthened to a three-month high.

   Although both the US and China have tried to send positive signals, it
   is unlikely that the world’s two biggest economies will be able to sign
   the interim deal this month — as some had hoped.

   Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit Greece and Brazil November 10
   -15, but so far his itinerary does not appear to include a stop in the
   U.S. There is also no indication of any meeting between Xi and U.S.
   President Donald Trump during the trip.

   Xi will attend an emerging markets summit in Brazil and hold talks in
   Greece about a “development regarding the [Chinese-owned] Port of
   Piraeus,” according to vice foreign minister Qin Gang.

   “Besides the Port of Piraeus, the two sides will also talk about how to
   better build the Belt and Road Initiative,” Qin said.

   An initial plan for Xi and Trump to meet on the sidelines of the
   Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile on November 16 and 17
   had to be abandoned when the Chilean government canceled the forum
   because of social unrest.

   Trump and other U.S. officials have since suggested that a meeting
   could be held in Iowa, Hawaii or Alaska.

   At a recent closed-door event in Washington for members of the
   U.S.-China Business Council — a non-profit organization aimed at
   promoting trade between the countries — a senior Chinese diplomat said
   a presidential meeting appeared “extremely important” for Trump but
   that Beijing did not see it as critical, according to a source who
   attended the event.

   The Chinese diplomat also said Beijing felt that Trump was fixated on a
   “phase one” deal for domestic political purposes, according to the
   source.

   An interim trade deal is widely expected to include a U.S. pledge to
   scrap tariffs scheduled for December 15 on about $156 billion worth of
   Chinese imports, including mobile phones, laptop computers and toys.
   China is expected to buy more U.S. agricultural products, open up its
   financial markets and address restrictions on genetically modified
   American food, but the deal may not include Chinese energy purchases
   from the U.S.

   Rory Green, an economist from TS Lombard, said the Ministry of
   Commerce’s announcement was a positive signal.

   “Improved household sentiment will support retail sales. Greater
   business confidence will eventually show in investment data, however
   there will be some lag between signature of the deal and a signs of
   improvement in monthly data series,” he said.

   Green said he did not expect a pickup in Chinese exports this year, but
   a positive turn would come in the first quarter of 2020, with
   improvements in U.S. and European demand helping sales.

   Ding Shuang, chief economist for Greater China and North Asia at
   Standard Chartered, said that if both sides confirmed the tariff
   removal, the decision should be a positive step.

   “A phased rollback of extra trade war tariffs indicates that it is a
   solution acceptable to both countries,” he said.

   “It also lays a foundation for future negotiations, which is quite
   significant.

   “There are still some difficulties ... but at least we now know that
   the final agreement is linked to tariff cuts, which was not clear
   before. China is willing to make promises in many aspects, but the
   compromises must lead to tariff cuts.”

   But Yu Chunhai, from Renmin University’s school of economics, said the
   announcement might simply reflect China’s expectations, given that the
   U.S. had not said it had agreed to it.

   “There are still many uncertainties. A partial tariff withdrawal might
   happen only when the two sides make breakthroughs in terms of an
   agreement,” he said.

   “A phase one deal won’t be affected by the U.S. declining China’s
   demand for a tariff withdrawal. It’s part of China’s negotiation
   strategy. More important, it shows China is thinking about the future
   and preventing the U.S. from asking for big concessions in the more
   difficult second and third phases.”
