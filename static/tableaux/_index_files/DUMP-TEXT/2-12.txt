   Public support for free trade is shrinking and the long-standing
   political consensus that trade liberalization is beneficial is under
   attack. The US in particular has recently shifted towards protectionism
   by imposing tariffs and continuously threatening its largest trading
   partners, in particular the EU and China. Brexit, too, is partly driven
   by a protectionist attitude: although the UK intends to enter into Free
   Trade Agreements (FTAs) with other countries, the move away from the
   single market is itself a rejection of free trade within the EU.

The US strategy

   Despite the potential of the Trump Administration's trade strategy to
   attract voters in poor, deindustrialized regions who feel left behind
   by globalization, it puts the enormous achievements of the last decades
   – both in the US and globally – at risk. Expanded trade between 1950
   and 2016 has increased US gross domestic product (GDP) by $7,014 per
   capita and $18,131 per household. The increased costs of imports as a
   consequence of the 2018 trade dispute, on the other hand, have resulted
   in annual consumer and producer losses of 0.37% of GDP and an aggregate
   welfare loss of 0.04% of GDP.

   Have the benefits of globalization been sufficiently equitably
   distributed in the US? There is a question about whether successive
   administrations have done enough to mitigate or slow the disruption
   caused by globalization in local communities, for example, when a
   traditional industry such as steel-making declines because it can be
   done more efficiently in another country.

   To date, the US government's own domestic fiscal and industrial
   policies – not free trade or globalization – have determined whether
   the economic benefits of globalization have been shared widely
   throughout society or whether they have increased inequality. They have
   determined whether a rust belt town dependent on a declining industry
   receives funding, retrains workers or offers tax breaks to attract new
   investment to diversify and evolve its economy. Public anger is backed
   by data showing America's low and middle-income households have seen
   little of the huge economic growth unleashed by free trade in recent
   decades. It may be politically expedient to suggest China has somehow
   forced Americans to buy too many of their goods rather than look at
   policy at home, but this directs public perception and anger in the
   wrong direction, deliberately or otherwise.

   American businesses, workers and consumers do not benefit from
   protectionism. Although protectionism can shield domestic jobs in
   individual sectors, repeated claims that high tariffs will protect
   domestic jobs or even create jobs need to be treated with great caution
   since secondary effects may lead to job losses in other sectors. Higher
   tariffs increase trade costs, leading to a lower disposable income per
   household. For example, in 2009 the US Administration under President
   Obama temporarily increased tariffs on Chinese car and light truck tyre
   imports. Within two years, employment in the US tire manufacturing
   industry grew with 1,200 new jobs, but tyre prices increased. This
   reduced US household purchasing power, resulting in approximately 3,500
   job losses in the retail sector.

   The Trump administration often points to the US trade deficit with the
   EU and China, which it wants to tackle. This message may be of benefit
   in terms of politics but is too simplistic. The notion that trade
   deficits are bad in principle ignores that importing cheap intermediate
   goods makes US manufacturers more competitive on the global market,
   boosting exports to elsewhere. Furthermore, foreign firms exporting to
   the US may be owned by US investors or work with US-owned service
   providers such as law firms or auditors, redirecting profits to the US.
   Lastly, domestic consumers benefit from imports as competition and
   increased product variety lower prices.

   We must not forget that trade disputes are not a one-way street, but
   always imply the danger of retaliatory measures. Such measures caused a
   $15.28 billion reduction in US exports of goods in the second half of
   2018 alone. Additionally, the US has become vulnerable, because
   retaliatory measures by a number of countries have many US exports to
   be taxed in global markets. Reciprocal retaliatory measures may lead to
   escalation, which is the greatest danger to global growth. The 1930
   Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act raised tariffs on more than 20,000 goods,
   inducing large trading partners to take retaliatory action. This
   diminished two-thirds of world trade, aggravated the Great Depression
   and contributed to the creation of a feeding ground for totalitarianism
   around the world. The risks here are not small.

   According to current estimates, an escalation in protectionism
   worldwide would lead to a permanent loss of 4% of GDP for the EU and 3%
   for the US. A large share of the US' Euro-area imports are intermediate
   goods used in manufacturing and then re-exported to other countries. An
   escalation would destroy the complex supply chains formed in recent
   decades. Where intermediate goods cross borders multiple times before
   the final product is made, applying tariffs increases the price of the
   final product and hits manufacturers hard, while consumers bear the
   negative consequences of higher prices.

   We must not be naive but rather recognize that unfair foreign practices
   need to be fought off. This legitimate aim can justify protectionist
   measures to a certain degree, but trade disputes won't do the job. In
   particularly critical fields, we must protect our key strategic
   industries through effective foreign investment reviews. Elsewhere
   diplomacy is the only way forward and whenever a forum for debate is
   needed, the right place is a reformed World Trade Organization (WTO).

EU still committed to free trade

   Protectionist policies in the US are a major concern for the EU,
   because the US is a particularly important trading partner. In 2018,
   21% of the EU's exports in goods went to the US and 13% of imports came
   from the US.

   In stark contrast to the US, the EU holds on to its belief in free
   trade. It is not free of protectionist voices, however such policies do
   not shape the EU's current strategy. Rather, in line with its Market
   Access Strategy, the EU successfully tackles trade and investment
   barriers through diplomatic actions, dispute settlement in the WTO and,
   most importantly, new trade agreements. Recently, the EU has concluded
   agreements with, Singapore, the Mercosur states (Argentina, Brazil,
   Paraguay and Uruguay), Japan and Vietnam. These agreements will,
   however, only partly make up for the disruptions caused by Brexit and
   the US strategy. Owing to the long-standing trading relationship, new
   trade agreements cannot easily compensate for the damage that might be
   done to complex supply and value chains formed across the Atlantic
   Channel.

   The EU is driven by the understanding that trade and globalization have
   increased prosperity for the vast majority of families, businesses and
   workers.

   For historical reasons, the EU is also very much interested in using
   trade to maintain stability. Trade relations helped to limit the danger
   of economic competition degenerating into geopolitical rivalry in the
   post-World War II order. The exchange of goods also promotes an
   exchange of cultures and humanizes trading partners. Trade disputes, on
   the other hand, may escalate, putting international security at risk.

No long-term winners

   Trade disputes do not produce winners in the long-term, although
   calculations are often presented to the contrary. A recent calculation
   by the Ifo-Institute found that Germany and other EU economies may
   benefit if the US implements further tariffs on Chinese imports. These
   findings were somewhat superficially cited in major newspapers,
   however, the calculation did not take into account the negative effects
   of investor uncertainty nor the possibility of a devaluation of the
   Chinese currency.

   Of course, in individual cases, certain countries may temporarily
   benefit from bilateral trade disputes since the flow goods may be
   diverted. Vietnam's exports to the US, for example, have increased by
   40% this year, because Chinese businesses have relocated their
   distribution to Vietnam in order to circumvent US tariffs. However,
   there is always the danger that the beneficiary may also be targeted,
   which would not only put an end to such beneficial side-effects but
   further escalate the trade dispute.

   It would be short-sighted to declare the (short-term) beneficiaries of
   trade tensions winners, since they too are affected by dangers for the
   global economy as a whole. Such dangers can particularly result from
   uncertainty. Businesses planning to enter into new markets or already
   conducting international business are likely to decrease their
   investment activity. In the US, for example, tariff worries caused 30%
   of manufacturers and 25% of goods producers to reassess their capital
   expenditure plans in 2018. International trade flows in intermediate
   goods may be affected disproportionately in response to uncertainty
   shocks. Uncertainty may also lead to risk reassessment, reducing
   investment and potentially hindering productivity. These effects are
   visible already: the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
   Development (OECD) forecasts that uncertainties concerning current
   trade disputes will lead to a reduction in business investment growth
   from 3.5% in 2017 and 2018 to 1.75% in 2019 and 2020. It would be naive
   to assume that countries temporarily benefitting from a diversion of
   trade flows would not be harmed by such effects in the long-term.

   The current challenges to the world economy are worrying and it is
   unclear whether satisfactory solutions can be found in the near future.
   The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the OECD, therefore, rightly
   call for policy actions to reduce trade tensions. In order to boost
   public support for free trade, it is particularly important to counter
   the short-sighted notion that trade disputes produce both winners and
   losers and acknowledge the role that national governments have played,
   with their fiscal policies that did not spread the benefits of
   globalization fairly and failed to soften the disruption to older
   industries. The truth is that, in the long-term, trade tensions will
   only produce losers as the implied dangers could demolish the progress
   of recent decades.
