About Your Privacy on this Site

   Welcome! Time collects data to deliver the best content, services, and
   personalized digital ads. We partner with third party advertisers, who
   may use tracking technologies to collect information about your
   activity on sites and applications across devices, both on our sites
   and across the Internet.

   You always have the choice to experience our sites without personalized
   advertising based on your web browsing activity by visiting the DAA’s
   Consumer Choice page, the NAI's website, and/or the EU online choices
   page, from each of your browsers or devices. To avoid personalized
   advertising based on your mobile app activity, you can install the
   DAA’s AppChoices app here. You can find much more information about
   your privacy choices in our privacy policy. You can make a Data Subject
   Request at any time.  Even if you choose not to have your activity
   tracked by third parties for advertising services, you will still see
   non-personalized ads on our site.

   By clicking continue below and using our sites or applications, you
   agree that we and our third party advertisers can:
     * transfer your personal data to the United States or other
       countries, and
     * process your personal data to serve you with personalized ads,
       subject to your choices as described above and in our privacy
       policy.
