Will Trump Back Down as His Trade War with China Bites the U.S. Economy?

   If there were any lingering doubt that Donald Trump’s trade war with
   China is exerting a considerable cost on the American economy, it was
   erased on Tuesday, when a closely watched statistic indicated that
   factory output dropped in August. The news confirmed other recent
   suggestions that the manufacturing sector has entered a recession.

   That doesn’t mean the over-all economy is slumping—not yet, anyway.
   These days, manufacturing is dwarfed by the giant service sector, which
   includes industries like health care, finance, and retailing. But it’s
   still a key part of the economy, and it plays an outsized role in Trump
   country, particularly the Midwest.

   During the 2016 campaign, Trump promised to restore manufacturing to
   its former glory, and during the first two years of his Presidency he
   boasted frequently about how well it was going. On Tuesday, he didn’t
   comment on the new report, which coincided with another drop on Wall
   Street. Last week, stock prices rose as traders seized upon hopeful
   statements from U.S. and Chinese officials about restarting the stalled
   trade talks. Now the reality of the situation has set in.

   This past Sunday, a raft of new tariffs on Chinese goods entering the
   United States went into effect. So did some new duties on American
   goods entering China, which Beijing imposed as a retaliatory move.
   Unlike the initial Trump tariffs, which were levied mainly on
   “intermediate products” made in China, such as parts for computers and
   autos, the new levies, of fifteen per cent, apply to many consumer
   goods, including clothes and sports equipment. That means their
   effects—higher prices—will be more visible to ordinary Americans.

   The Republicans’ Abject Submission to Trump at the House Impeachment
   Vote

   By John Cassidy
   Though impeachment puts Donald Trump at risk of being removed from
   office, in many ways it is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who faces the
   highest political stakes.

   Nancy Pelosi’s Impeachment Gamble

   By David Rohde

   As recently as March, Trump claimed that “trade wars are good, and easy
   to win.” That statement ignored history and the business environment
   facing American manufacturing companies. Many U.S. businesses, facing a
   steep price hike for the Chinese-made components they rely on to
   assemble finished goods, were forced to try to source from other
   countries. Meanwhile, the entire manufacturing sector was faced with
   rising uncertainty about when, or whether, the trade war would be
   resolved. With Trump issuing dire threats one moment and making nice
   with Xi Jinping the next, it was hard for anyone to figure out how
   things would play out.

   The net results of all of this were cuts in production and
   postponements to capital investments. Back in April, just one month
   after Trump issued his idle boast, the manufacturing index maintained
   by the Institute for Supply Management, a nonprofit trade group,
   started to drop. Tuesday’s announcement confirmed that the index, which
   is based on a survey of purchasing managers at large and small firms,
   slid again in August. That means it has fallen for five months in a
   row, and the chain of causation isn’t in dispute. For the respondents
   to the monthly I.S.M. survey, when it comes to lost manufacturing
   power, “trade remains the most significant issue,” Timothy Fiore, who
   compiles the index, told National Public Radio on Tuesday.

   In spite of Trump’s bluster, he is looking more and more boxed in. All
   along, his thinking has been that export-dependent China simply
   couldn’t withstand a lengthy trade war with its largest trading
   partner. But the government in Beijing has held firm, despite a sharp
   slowdown in the Chinese economy. Rather than acceding to Trump’s
   demands for extensive changes in how it organizes its economy and
   treats American firms, China has responded to each of his escalations
   with retaliatory measures. On Sunday, the Chinese government filed a
   complaint over Trump’s latest tariffs with the World Trade
   Organization, the intergovernmental ruling body that it joined in 2001.
   In a statement, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said that China would
   “firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests” and “firmly
   defend the multilateral trading system and international trade order in
   accordance with relevant WTO rules.”

   With the Communist Party of China gearing up for a big celebration at
   the start of next month, marking the seventieth anniversary of the
   establishment of the People’s Republic, it seems unlikely that Chinese
   trade negotiators will make any big concessions during the next few
   weeks. Will Trump? Unlike Xi and other Chinese leaders, he has an
   election to worry about. The conflicting signals he sent during
   August—escalating his tariff threats and then talking up the
   possibility of a resolution after the Dow dived—demonstrated that he is
   at least intermittently aware of the political constraints he faces.

   As part of his strategy of escalation, he has threatened to further
   expand his tariffs on October 1st and December 15th. If these changes
   went into effect, virtually all imports from China would be facing some
   sort of a levy, and the average rate would be 24.3 per cent, according
   to Chad Bown, of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
   China would retaliate again, and, entering an election year, Trump
   would be in an all-out trade war. It can only be guessed how the stock
   market would react to this prospect. Despite the prospect of more
   interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, it may be ugly.

   The alternative could be for Trump to accept some sort of a face-saving
   deal, in which China agreed to increase its imports of American goods,
   particularly agricultural goods, and the United States agreed to roll
   back some of its tariffs and ease the restrictions it has imposed on
   Huawei, the Chinese technology company. Such a deal would involve the
   Trump Administration setting aside, at least for now, its demands for
   structural changes to China’s model of state-led capitalism. But it
   might calm the nerves of investors and help prevent the troubles of the
   manufacturing sector from spreading into the broader economy. (Over-all
   spending by consumers has held up pretty well so far, but a report,
   released on Friday, showed consumer confidence taking a dive in
   August.)

   On Tuesday, Tariff Man was back in Twitter-attack mode, warning China
   not to try to wait out his Administration, saying that the terms of a
   deal in his second term would be “MUCH TOUGHER.” China’s supply chain,
   Trump said, would “crumble” in the meantime. Words are cheap. Over the
   next few weeks, his actions will be the thing to watch.
