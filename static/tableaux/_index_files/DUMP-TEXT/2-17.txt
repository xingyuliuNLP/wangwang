US-China Trade War Will Never End

   US-China Trade Talks Open In Washington DC

   WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 30: U.S. Trade Representative Robert
   Lighthizer (2nd R), Commerce Secretary ... [+] Wilbur Ross (R),
   Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow and other Trump
   Administration officials sit down with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He (L),
   Central Bank Governor Yi Gang (2nd L) and other Chinese vice ministers
   and senior officials for negotiations in the Diplomatic Room at the
   Eisenhower Executive Office Building January 30, 2019 in Washington,
   DC. The top trade officials are beginning two days of face-to-face
   trade talks to end a months-long trade war between the world’s two
   largest economies. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)

   America and China will reach tentative trade deals that appease
   hard-liners on both ends. But they will never reach a real deal that
   changes the structure and the culture of the Chinese society—and
   therefore end the trade war.

   American and Chinese trade negotiators seem to have reached a
   “principal consensus” in trade talks. That’s according to a Xinhua
   report published on Friday.

   “In phone talks, the two sides had earnest and constructive discussions
   on properly addressing each other's core concerns, and reached
   principled consensus,” says the report.

   That paves the way for some sort of agreement in the near future. “I
   think the Trump administration and China will strike a nominal trade
   deal of some kind within the next month - with agreements for
   agricultural goods and other trade issues that don't come with a lot of
   controversial baggage,” says Jeff Yastine, Senior Equities Analyst at
   Banyan Hill Publishing. “It'll be just enough for both sides to claim
   "victory" without necessarily having won any more substantive ground
   than when they started.”

   Still, that will be sufficient to save face on both sides at this
   point.

   “Chinese negotiators can take it back to Xi and he'll sign it to
   appease his own powerbase of party apparatchiks, Yastine adds. “And
   Trump can wave the agreement around at election rallies and say that he
   was able to bend the Chinese to his own will.

   ” But he thinks that this deal won’t address thorny issues.

   “As far as substantial trade breakthroughs, on thorny issues like
   intellectual property and opening up the Chinese financial system to US
   banks - I don't think that will happen, in what's left of Trump's first
   term or in a second term if he wins one.,” says Yastine. “Without an
   election to win in 2024, I doubt that the president would even care to
   make it a priority of his administration.”

   In fact, it may never happen, under any US President. Addressing
   China’s intellectual property issue requires both a change in the
   centuries old tradition that treats intellectual property as a “public
   good.” And opening up China’s financial system to US banks will
   undermine the vested interests of China’s ruling class. It uses banks
   to allocate credit according to political fiat rather than market
   forces.

   Besides, opening up banks to competition could create a banking crisis
   similar to that which Japan experienced in the 1990s after it opened up
   its own banking system to US banks.

   Then there are China’s grandiose claims in the South China Sea, which
   pit China against the US and its allies over
   freedom-of-navigation, and are commingled with trade.

   Still, Yastine is hopeful that a real trade deal may be reached if
   markets force the two sides to hold serious talks. “The only x-factor
   that might change the current trade algebra is if there was some kind
   of global stock market crash or banking crisis. Much as we saw in 2008,
   events of that type tend to focus the attention of policymakers and
   make heretofore "impossible" deals possible,” he says.

   “In such a situation, the threat of events spinning even further out of
   the control of both sides might be just enough to compel them to hold
   serious talks and eliminate this large amount of uncertainty hanging
   over the global economy.”
