Trump’s Made-for-TV Trade War Keeps World Guessing

   The president’s unpredictability and demands of China are complicating
   an end to the long-running dispute, experts say.

   When President Trump’s advisers suggested that Beijing resume buying
   around $20 billion in American farm products as part of a trade deal,
   Mr. Trump wasn’t satisfied. In a dramatic public retelling in the
   Cabinet Room, he said he pressed his team to more than triple that
   figure, then trimmed that a little and asked for up to $50 billion in
   annual purchases.

   “My people had $20 billion done,” Mr. Trump recounted in an Oct. 21
   cabinet meeting. “And I said, ‘I want more.’ They said, ‘The farmers
   can’t handle it.’ I said, ‘Tell them to buy larger tractors. It’s very
   simple.’” The cabinet members gathered around Mr. Trump laughed.

   Mr. Trump has brought his characteristic love of show business to trade
   talks with China, injecting public drama into typically staid
   proceedings. He has alternated displays of anger and warmth toward
   Beijing and assumed the role of the insatiable negotiator, pairing
   ambitious goals for a trade pact with even bigger threats should China
   not accede to his terms.

   But more than a year and a half into the biggest trade war in modern
   history, Mr. Trump’s approach has not yet produced the grand finale he
   hoped for. Instead, the president’s cliffhanger tactics appear to have
   made it even harder to bring complex trade talks to a close and
   exacerbated economic uncertainty across the globe.

   Despite Mr. Trump’s Oct. 11 announcement that the United States and
   China had reached a “historic” Phase 1 trade agreement, actually
   signing a deal has proved elusive. The two sides continue to negotiate
   and could finalize an agreement in the next few weeks, if negotiators
   decide to compromise. But Mr. Trump continues to give mixed signals
   about whether he actually wants a deal and if any of his tariffs on
   $360 billion worth of Chinese goods will ever be removed.

   “We’re taking in billions of dollars in tariff money from China,” Mr.
   Trump said on Nov. 8. “I like our situation very much. They want to
   make a deal much more than I do, but we could have a deal.”

   A prolonged trade war offers Mr. Trump some political advantages: It
   allows him to maintain a tough public stance toward China and avoid
   Democratic criticism that he is caving to Beijing.

   But businesses are not entertained. The unrelenting trade fight has
   prolonged financial pain for American farmers, companies and consumers,
   paralyzing firms that rely on robust trade flows between the world’s
   two largest economies.

   Executives across the world say they have no choice but to postpone
   some hiring and investment, make sure any new expansions are not
   crippled by unforeseen policies, and conserve cash.

   The uncertainty is weighing on the United States economy, particularly
   manufacturing, which has slumped over the past several months. Chinese
   economic growth has slowed to its lowest rate in nearly three decades,
   while Germany has barely avoided falling into recession.

   “It’s striking that in almost every corner of the world geopolitical
   tensions are threatening to put the brakes on growth,” John Williams,
   the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech
   last week. “The uncertainty created by current events is no doubt
   having a lasting effect on the economic conditions we’re experiencing
   today.”

   Mr. Trump’s theatrical embrace is not limited to China. He has injected
   similar drama into trade talks with other partners, including Europe,
   Japan, Canada and Mexico, publicly threatening them with tariffs and
   suggesting he might leave some trading partners behind.

   The president says his approach has created leverage — and in some
   cases, he is right. The threat of tariffs has prompted officials from
   Mexico, Canada, Japan and elsewhere to make concessions they might not
   otherwise have agreed to. It has also brought China, which is heavily
   reliant on exports to the United States, to the negotiating table.

   But that strategy may now be discouraging China from bringing the talks
   to a close. Mr. Trump’s tendency to waver and increase his demands have
   made China wary of offering concessions, for fear that he will only
   demand more, people familiar with Chinese trade policy said.

   Eswar Prasad, a trade professor at Cornell, said the president’s
   “mercurial temperament and predilection to undercutting his own
   negotiating team” had complicated the already challenging task of
   striking a deal. “By hyping up expectations and setting unrealistic
   goals for the trade talks, Trump makes the prospects for any sort of
   trade deal with China more uncertain and volatile,” he said.

   The two sides have been unable to reschedule a meeting between Mr.
   Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Chile that was
   canceled because of domestic protests. Mr. Trump has since said that a
   deal signing would take place in United States “farm country,” but the
   Chinese have been reluctant to commit to a meeting until a deal that
   includes tariff reductions is finalized.

   Without a set deadline, the two sides have lost a source of external
   pressure to get the deal done. Beijing is also concerned about the
   president’s unpredictable behavior — as demonstrated by his abrupt
   departure from a high-profile meeting last February in Hanoi with North
   Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. They fear that Mr. Trump may end up giving
   fewer concessions than they anticipate, resulting in an embarrassing
   trip for Mr. Xi, according to people familiar with their thinking.

   Mr. Trump continues to insist his tactics will be worth it, saying he
   is the only president tough enough to take on China without fear of
   repercussions and that the United States will be better off. Many
   businesses agree that China has long taken advantage of the United
   States and support Mr. Trump’s efforts to remove trade barriers and end
   coercive practices that have disadvantaged American firms operating in
   China.

   But they have struggled with his approach, which has repeatedly
   escalated tensions, prolonging the trade fight far longer than most
   expected. The lack of resolution has been discouraging, given that many
   analysts believe that the administration is tackling only the easiest
   issues in its Phase 1 deal, and leaving more contentious topics, like
   the subsidies that China gives to its industry, for later talks.

   The roller-coaster ride has been exasperating for businesses that
   thrive on certainty and cannot easily shift supply chains or adjust
   shipments of products that need weeks to cross oceans. The most recent
   twists in the China trade talks have left firms uncertain whether a 15
   percent tariff that the Trump administration had planned to impose Dec.
   15 on another $160 billion of goods, including smartphones, laptops and
   footwear, would go into effect — or whether a 15 percent tariff imposed
   on consumer goods in September would remain.

   “It makes for better theater to hold this to the last minute,” said
   Phil Levy, the chief economist at Flexport, which coordinates
   international shipments for companies. “It really doesn’t fit well with
   the world of global supply chains. And we’re talking to a lot of
   businesses who are having difficulty with that.”

   Even Mr. Trump’s supporters have trouble at times disguising their
   frustration with his focus on showmanship over substance and a nagging
   feeling that the president doesn’t want the show to end.

   In a letter to the president in May, Zippy Duvall, the president of the
   American Farm Bureau, said farmers faced “near-unprecedented economic
   uncertainty and hardship” stemming from the escalation of tariffs in
   China and other key markets. He urged Mr. Trump to make a deal as soon
   as possible, saying “time is running out for many in agriculture.”

   But Mr. Trump’s approach has complicated his ability to get a final
   deal, including securing the big farm commitments that he showcased
   last month. American negotiators are now left with the difficult task
   of translating the massive purchases Mr. Trump requested — larger
   purchases “than any time in our history, by far” — into the actual text
   of a trade agreement.

   While China needs and wants to buy agricultural goods like soybeans and
   pork, it has balked on terms that would leave it exposed to accusations
   that it favors American products over other countries’, as well as
   agreements that could result in more American tariffs if its purchases
   do not come through.

   Even if American negotiators secure better market access for beef,
   pork, dairy and genetically modified products, Washington-based
   analysts who have done the calculations say they have difficulty
   figuring out how the United States could increase its agricultural
   exports to China to much more than $30 billion a year, without
   diverting trade from elsewhere.

   Mr. Trump’s tariffs also remain a source of uncertainty, with his
   administration sending mixed signals about whether any of the existing
   levies will be removed if a deal is reached.

   The president announced the Phase 1 trade deal during a meeting in the
   Oval Office with Liu He, China’s top trade negotiator. While Mr. Trump
   canceled an increase in tariffs planned for Oct. 15, he made no mention
   of rolling back any levies. That has not gone over well with the
   Chinese, who have since been under pressure domestically for seemingly
   giving away too much to the United States.

   “Without rolling back some of the tariffs, or reducing the uncertainty
   of not raising additional tariffs, then I would ask what is the
   additional incentive of implementing this deal on the Chinese part?” He
   Jianxiong, the former executive director for China at the International
   Monetary Fund, said at a Nov. 6 event at the Peterson Institute in
   Washington.
