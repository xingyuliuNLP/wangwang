   BEIJING (Reuters) - A Sino-U.S. trade war could ease somewhat but wider
   conflicts between the world’s two largest economies will continue, Lou
   Jiwei, a former Chinese finance minister, said on Saturday.

   “Look at the next development, there could be compromises in the trade
   war at a certain stage, and we have seen signs of compromising,” Lou,
   now an official with a body that advises China’s parliament, told an
   economic forum in Beijing.

   Officials from both countries on Thursday said China and the United
   States had agreed to roll back tariffs already put in place on each
   others’ goods if a “phase one” deal was concluded, but the idea has
   been met with opposition from some quarters of the administration U.S.
   President Donald Trump.

   Trump himself, in comments that hit stock prices and the dollar, said
   on Friday he had not agreed to a tariff rollback.

   Washington has adopted a strategy to contain China’s economic rise by
   preventing the country from climbing up the global value chain, Lou
   said.

   “Containment and counter-containment are inevitable and that will be a
   long-term issue,” he said.

   But Lou also said it would be difficult for the United States to
   decouple from China, given the potential disruption to global supply
   chains and the impact on businesses.

   The U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports will not fundamentally resolve its
   trade deficit, which is caused by the high U.S. government debt ratio
   and a low household savings rate, he said.

   China should open up its economy wider to foreign investors, but it
   should not rush to relax its capital controls, Lou said.
