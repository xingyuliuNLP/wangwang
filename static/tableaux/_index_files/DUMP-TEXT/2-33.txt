How to Get Past the US-China Trade War

   Nov 7, 2019 Dani Rodrik

   China and the United States, like all other countries, should be able
   to maintain their own economic model. But international trade rules
   should prohibit national governments from adopting
   “beggar-thy-neighbor” policies that provide domestic benefits only by
   imposing costs on trade partners.

   CAMBRIDGE – China’s economic rise poses significant political and
   strategic challenges to the existing global order. The emergence of a
   new superpower in Asia has inevitably produced geopolitical tensions
   that some have warned may eventually result in military conflict. Even
   absent war, the hardening of China’s political regime, amid credible
   allegations of myriad human-rights abuses, raises difficult questions
   for the West.

The Suleimani Assassination and US Strategic Incoherence

   Richard N. Haass

   Following its targeted killing of Iran's second most powerful leader,
   the US could well find itself with no alternative but to devote more
   military resources to the Middle East, a path that could lead to
   additional Iranian provocations. And that shift would occur at a time
   of growing challenges to US interests elsewhere in the world.

What Does Suleimani’s Death Change?

   Shlomo Ben-Ami

   The targeted killing by the United States of one of Iran's top military
   leaders represents a significant symbolic defeat for the Iranian
   regime, but it does not augur all-out war. After all, Iran and the US
   have already been at war for decades, and neither side has an interest
   in an uncontrolled military escalation now.

   Then there is the economics. China has become the world’s top trader,
   and its increasingly sophisticated manufacturing exports dominate
   global markets. While China’s international economic role is unlikely
   to be insulated from political conflict, it is also inconceivable that
   the West will stop trading with China.

   But what kind of rules should apply to trade between countries with
   such different economic and political systems? I recently teamed up
   with Jeffrey Lehman, Vice Chancellor of New York University’s Shanghai
   campus, and Yao Yang, Dean of the National School of Development at
   Peking University, to convene a working group of economists and legal
   scholars that could devise some answers. Our working group recently
   issued a joint statement, with support from 34 additional scholars,
   including five Nobel laureate economists.

   China’s admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001, and the
   establishment of the WTO itself, was predicated on the implicit premise
   that national economies, including China’s, would converge to a broadly
   similar model, enabling significant (or “deep”) economic integration.
   China’s unorthodox economic regime – characterized by opaque government
   intervention, industrial policies, and a continuing role for
   state-owned enterprises (SOEs) alongside markets – has been very
   successful in spurring GDP growth and reducing poverty. But it makes
   deep economic integration with the West impossible.

   An alternative perspective gaining ground in the United States is that
   the American economy should decouple from the Chinese economy. This
   would entail high trade barriers to Chinese exports and severe
   restrictions on bilateral investment flows. Such an approach would
   further intensify and render permanent US President Donald Trump’s
   trade war.

   We propose a middle ground between convergence and decoupling. The key
   is that China and the US, like all other countries, should be able to
   maintain their own economic model. Trade and other policies aimed at
   safeguarding (or “protecting”) a country’s economic system should be
   presumed legitimate. What is not acceptable are policies that would
   impose one country’s rules on another (through trade wars or other
   pressure) or that provide domestic benefits only by imposing costs on
   trade partners.

   Targeting the latter category, which economists call
   “beggar-thy-neighbor” (BTN) policies, is central to our approach. We
   argue that international trade rules should draw a bold red line around
   BTN policies and prohibit them. A typical example is trade restrictions
   that enable a country to exercise monopoly power globally, as China
   tried to do by restricting exports of rare earth minerals some years
   back. Another example, which may become increasingly relevant in
   digital technologies, is closure of domestic markets to foreign
   investors in order to obtain competitive scale benefits on world
   markets. A third example is persistently undervalued currencies that
   help sustain large macroeconomic imbalances (trade surpluses).

   Under this approach, many other policies that the US habitually
   complains about would not be considered objectionable. China’s
   industrial subsidies and SOEs, for example, would be considered a
   domestic matter. While they may hurt specific American firms and
   investors, such practices are not, in general, of a BTN nature: either
   they benefit the rest of the world in aggregate (as with subsidies), or
   their economic costs, where they exist, are borne primarily at home (as
   with state ownership).

   By the same token, the US would be free to adopt trade and investment
   policies that safeguard the integrity of its technological systems and
   protect communities adversely affected by imports. It could also
   insulate itself from any negative spillovers from Chinese policies, if
   it chose to do so, by imposing restrictions at the border. China must
   recognize that policy autonomy is a two-way street: other countries
   need it as much as China does.

   While our approach is stated in bilateral, US-China terms, it is easy
   to embed it in a multilateral framework – and even the WTO itself, with
   some creative legal maneuvering. One such approach is suggested by one
   of our working group members, Robert Staiger. The stark reality,
   however, is that progress on the multilateral front is unlikely without
   a prior agreement between the world’s two largest economies. Thus, we
   view our statement as an initial step in that direction.

   Like all international agreements, our proposed approach depends on the
   willingness of the parties to abide by the terms. While the concept of
   BTN may be clear to economists as an analytical matter, we are not so
   naive as to suppose that the US and China would quickly and easily
   agree in practice on what is and is not a BTN policy. Disputes about
   terms and definitions will persist. Even so, our hope is that a
   framework that sets out clear expectations, respects both countries’
   economic sovereignty, guards against the worst trade abuses, and allows
   the bulk of the gains from trade to be reaped would create the
   incentives needed to build mutual trust over time.

   This approach leaves open the question of how the US and other Western
   countries should respond to China’s political repression or human
   rights abuses. That is not because these issues are unimportant, but
   because clear rules of conduct in economic relations must be
   established regardless of how even bigger conflicts are to be resolved.
   Without such a roadmap, it is not just the economic interests of China
   and the US that will suffer. The rest of the world will pay a high
   price as well.

       I know Dani Rodrik means well but this article read like a
       desperate attempt to triangulate: to satisfy the US, China and also
       salvage some remnants of a rule-based system. I find these three
       incommensurable with the third option likely to be sacrificed. That
       means more conflict ahead, unfortunately.

       It's understandable that Prof. Rodrik should try to avoid blame for
       appearing to support Pres. Trump's trade wars etc., and Prof.
       Rodrik's distancing himself from anti-globalism rhetoric is welcome
       in any case.
       It's also a constructive contribution on his part to bring to
       people's attention that multilateral frameworks are available to
       deal with concerns like those commonly aired regarding
       international economic policies of China's government.
       However, the lede in Prof. Rodrik's essay -- "China’s economic rise
       poses significant political and strategic challenges to the
       existing global order" -- isn't consistent with the facts. On the
       contrary, China appears to be integrating itself into the existing
       global order as well as others that one could name, and better than
       some.
       China's military rise poses challenges, in the South China Sea, for
       example, and the competition of Chinese firms poses economic
       challenges to other firms, Chinese and non-Chinese. But a vague
       claim that the existing global economic institutions are threatened
       by China is hardly justified.

       Is this proposal not merely kicking the can down the road, setting
       the scene for a much bigger blowup in a few years?
       No amount of soft peddling of China's 'opaqueness' alleviates the
       fact that China is a single party authoritarian state. Here's a
       thought experiment: suppose we go along with this 'parallel
       development models' scenario and allow Chinese state backed actors
       (tech or nuclear power stations or whatever) to sell into western
       infrastructure. So the west spends hundreds of billions. Then,
       because of some troublemakers in Hong Kong, China sends the tanks
       in. What is your response? Ignore the issue like the Khoshoggi
       murder? Or disengage at that point and pour hundreds of billions
       already spent down the drain? Or are you relying on, hoping, that
       China will democratise?

                 It absolutely does - the Saudi regime is disgusting. But
                 the Saudis, for all their attempts to export their
                 hideous model, don't possess the heft to upend western
                 liberal democracy. China has an implicit counter-offer of
                 a model that very definitely does. Don't get me wrong -
                 China, though nationalistic, is not inherently
                 aggressive, as the USSR was. The risk, for example of
                 nuclear conflict, is lower than with the USSR. But I'm
                 not convinced they should be indulged either by letting
                 them get on with horrors within their own sphere without
                 consequences. And what other action can the free world
                 take that would be at all effective, except refuse to do
                 business with them?

       I disagree with your view. As it stands, we see the accumulation of
       exorbitant capital and political power, with small segments of
       non-liberal societies (China, Russia, Saudi Arabia to name a few).
       That very power is used against Western liberal democracies in
       various ways. In the mean time, those systems are only sustainable
       by oppressing significant swaths of their societies, aided and
       abetted, in my view, by the very trade and finance relationships we
       engage in with oppressing, corrupt regimes.
       I do believe that the decoupling, not just between the US and China
       but broader, between liberal democratic societies and the rest, is
       the way to go as the current path has brought into stark
       perspective the irreconcilable nature of such relations with our
       core values. E.g. we would find the government's power as is the
       case in China unacceptable but we're willing to engage in trade
       relations that strengthen those very forces. We hail freedom of the
       press as one of the pillars of our system but when a Khashoggi is
       murdered, we all turn a blind eye because of defense spending and
       US posture. Surely there needs to be a term that really captures
       the notion of a geopolitical cognitive dissonance.

            Is the ultimate goal of pursuing political freedom not to
            improve people's lives? In Iraq and Libya, these countries
            rely on external forces to achieve so-called political
            freedom, what can ordinary people's lives look like? On the
            contrary, in South Korea and Taiwan Province of China,
            political freedom will naturally be realized with economic
            development and the improvement of people's living standards.

       "the hardening of China’s political regime, amid credible
       allegations of myriad human-rights abuses,"
       There is no sign that China's socialist 'regime' has hardened any
       more than that America's capitalist regime has done so. Indeed, the
       Chinese trust and approve of theirs far more than we do ours.
       As to the unfounded allegations of human rights abuses, readers are
       advised to revisit the UN Declaration of Universal Human Rights
       where they will find that, of the 30 rights enumerated, China leads
       the US by 26-2, with two draws.
