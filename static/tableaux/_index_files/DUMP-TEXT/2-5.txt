Trump's trade war is hurting China's economy, but it's giving Beijing an
opportunity it never dreamed of

          + President Donald Trump says China is desperate to end its
            trade war with the US, but while China's economy is slowing,
            policymakers aren't acting desperate.
          + There's evidence to suggest that China would rather go toe to
            toe with the US on trade than deal with it on more pressing
            domestic issues — such as Xinjiang and Hong Kong.
          + "The Chinese are not trying to win," Leland Miller, the
            founder of Chinese business and economic survey "China Beige
            Book," told Business Insider. "They're trying to stall so they
            get the best scenario they can across the board."
          + Trump's laser focus on getting a deal — instead of scaring the
            Chinese — is giving them an opportunity to accomplish other
            goals without US interference.
       President Trump will tell you China is "dying to make a deal" with
       the US. He will tell you that Beijing is tired of paying tariffs to
       the US (Americans actually pay them). He will tell you that China's
       supply chains are breaking, and that its economy is on the verge of
       collapse (arguable but not certain).
       "We're the ones that are deciding whether or not we want to make a
       deal," Trump said in a speech at the Economic Club of New York this
       month. "We're close."
       Trump's rhetoric on the trade deal represents a gross
       oversimplification of China's interests. The reality of what
       Beijing wants is far more complicated than an end to the recent
       economic hostilities. Instead, it is balancing a variety of
       interests, some more important than the trade war.
       "The Chinese are not trying to win," Leland Miller, the founder of
       Chinese business and economic survey "China Beige Book," told
       Business Insider. "They're trying to stall so they get the best
       scenario they can across the board."
       "Across the board" means a range of domestic, economic, and
       national-security issues. And "best scenario" means much more than
       a stable Chinese economy.
       Beijing's ideal scenario includes a free hand to violate human
       rights in Xinjiang and Hong Kong; it includes continuing to press
       for reunification with Taiwan; and it includes achieving the aims
       of China 2025, the Chinese Communist Party's plan to transition the
       country's economy to one based on technology.
       Trump's laser focus on trade has given Beijing the latitude to deal
       with those and other critical issues without fear interference from
       the White House.
       That is why some in China's community of think tanks and scholars
       believe that, in some ways, Trump benefits China. One former US
       State Department official with experience in East Asia, who spoke
       with Business Insider on condition of anonymity, said that, long
       term, there are four main reasons some in China think Trump is
       useful.
         1. He damages alliances.
         2. He damages US credibility and standing.
         3. He's taking the US out of the multilateral game.
         4. He's damaging long-term US economic competitiveness.
       On the other hand, Trump's quixotic nature has made him a
       frustrating counterpart to the Chinese.
       "[Chinese leaders are] at the point where Trump is so
       unpredictable," Miller said. "I don't buy the idea that the Chinese
       want him around. They would rather deal with anyone else. The deal
       they get from him may be better for China, but they can't trust
       he'll keep it. After this summer there is zero trust."

It's not the economy, stupid
       Trump is correct to say that the Chinese economy is slowing down,
       but there is little evidence to support his assertion that Beijing
       is "dying" to make a deal anytime soon.
       For months, Chinese economic data has been trending down, but it's
       only in the past few week that policymakers have slightly lowered
       key interest rates to keep money flowing through the economy.
       According to the economist Wei Yao, at Société Générale, that's
       because they were concerned about easier money exacerbating already
       high pork prices — pork is a staple of the Chinese diet, and high
       prices pull up inflation — and a housing bubble.
       In the past few weeks, pork prices have fallen, so policymakers
       have said that more easing on the way. But for the time being, we
       can continue to expect easing measures to be incremental steps made
       by a leadership carefully weighing and watching the trade war — not
       the actions of a desperate government on the verge of bending a
       knee to its strategic rival.
       Meanwhile, trade-war negotiations seem to have prompted the US to,
       for now, ease up restrictions on Huawei, the Chinese telecom
       company that has repeatedly drawn the attention of US officials and
       was accused by the Justice Department of violating US sanctions on
       Iran.
       China has also ignored US ire over its "Made in China 2025," a plan
       to build up China's tech sector using methods US officials have
       said violate the aims of the trade war — methods that allow more
       state control of China's economy and encourage more
       intellectual-property theft. While China stopped using the phrase
       "Made in China 2025" in its official communiques, this week it
       introduced an industrial policy with the same aims.
       "The main message I get from this is: We're pursuing a state-led,
       large firm development goal," Derek Scissors, a senior fellow and
       China-economy expert at the American Enterprise Institute, told the
       South China Morning Post. "They don't say anything about
       competition in here at all. The messaging is entirely consistent
       with Made in China 2025."
       So while yes, China's economy is slowing, it is neither in
       emergency mode, nor dramatically changing in response to US
       economic concerns and desires.

Holding back the hawks
       So if the trade war's effect on China's slowing economy is not the
       most existential threat to China, what is?
       For that, look to the issues Trump is ignoring, such as Hong Kong
       and Xinjiang. In what has undoubtedly been a missed opportunity to
       stand up for human rights, Trump has been fairly silent about
       millions of people in Hong Kong who've been protesting to protect
       their autonomous political arrangement with China.
       The problem for China, though, is that it seems as if China hawks
       in Washington are becoming bolder, regardless of the president's
       desire for a deal.
       Congress unanimously passed a law condemning China's actions in
       Hong Kong and requiring an annual review of Hong Kong's political
       autonomy upon which the city's status as a special trade partner
       with the US would be contingent. The law would consider sanctions
       against those involved in human-rights abuses against Hong Kong
       citizens and ensure US visa protections for demonstrators.
       But Trump already suggested in a Fox News interview on Friday that
       he may veto the bill because "we are also in the process of making
       one of the largest trade deals in history."
       "In almost every facet of foreign policy — national security, human
       rights — the US side could make things difficult for China," Miller
       said. "They have massive leverage."
       China, as you might imagine, was livid about the Hong Kong law and
       summoned William Klein, acting chargé d'affaires of the US Embassy
       in China, to lodge stern representations and strong protest against
       US Senate.
       We have yet to see China stage an equal freak-out about the trade
       war. Just this week was saw China stage a bigger freak-out about
       The New York Times' stunning and sickening report about violence
       and genocide in China's Xinjiang province, where the government is
       targeting the mostly-Muslim Uighur ethnic minority.
       "What the political types say ... is two things," Anne
       Stevenson-Yang, the founder of China-focused investment firm J
       Capital Research, said. "One, on economic issues, Trump can be
       bribed, and, two, on human rights, he leaves them alone."
       So, to Beijing, trade war considered, things could be a lot worse.
