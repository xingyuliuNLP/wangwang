   The world's two largest economies are locked in a bitter trade battle.

   The dispute, which has simmered for nearly 18 months, has seen the US
   and China impose tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of
   one another's goods.

   US President Donald Trump has long accused China of unfair trading
   practices and intellectual property theft.

   In China, there is a perception that the US is trying to curb its rise
   as a global economic power.

   Negotiations are ongoing but have proven difficult. In December, the
   two sides announced a preliminary deal but some of the thorniest issues
   remain unresolved.

   Uncertainty surrounding the trade war has hurt businesses and weighed
   on the global economy.

What tariffs have been imposed?

   Mr Trump's tariffs policy aims to encourage consumers to buy American
   by making imported goods more expensive.

   So far, the US has imposed tariffs on more than $360bn (£268bn) of
   Chinese goods, and China has retaliated with tariffs on more than
   $110bn of US products.

   Washington delivered three rounds of tariffs last year, and a fourth
   one in September. The most recent round targeted Chinese imports, from
   meat to musical instruments, with a 15% duty.

   Beijing has hit back with tariffs ranging from 5% to 25% on US goods.

   Its latest tariff strike included a 5% levy on US crude oil, the first
   time fuel has been hit in the trade battle.

What's next?

   The so-called "phase one" deal agreed in December reduces some US
   tariffs in exchange for more Chinese purchases of American products,
   and better protection for US intellectual property.

   The deal is yet to be signed and tariffs of 25% on $250bn worth of
   Chinese goods remain in place.

   However, the US will drop tariffs on $120bn worth of Chinese goods to
   7.5%.

   Washington also shelved a planned round of tariffs, which would have
   hit Chinese smartphones, clothing and toys.
