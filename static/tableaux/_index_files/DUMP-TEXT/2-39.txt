One CEO’s tortuous path to surviving Trump’s trade wars

   Perhaps no corporate executive in America has been whiplashed more by
   President Donald Trump’s trade wars than Tom Werner.

   It’s not that his company, San Jose, California-based solar-panel maker
   SunPower Corp., has been ruined by the trade tumult. In some ways, it’s
   arguably no worse off today than it was before Trump imposed tariffs on
   imported equipment.

   But the sheer breadth of the shifting winds that have buffeted SunPower
   and repeatedly forced 59-year-old Werner to rethink strategy and the
   company’s supply chain sheds light on the toll of the trade war. The
   saga also underscores why executives across America have sought policy
   certainty from the Trump administration.

   Over the past two years, SunPower was hit with duties on panels it
   makes overseas; won an exemption; was threatened with tariffs on
   equipment it makes in Mexico; and watched rivals gain access to a
   tariff loophole.

   During this time, Werner bought a manufacturing plant in Oregon, sold
   it, leased space in that factory, announced that the company would
   split into two and worked to raise cash through a share sale.

   Along the way, Werner became a regular at the Sofitel hotel by
   Lafayette Square in Washington and the Sweetgreen salad shop nearby.
   Back and forth he went — more than a dozen times last year — to
   persuade officials to exempt his company from tariffs. “It was
   surreal,” he says. “I went from running a business to being in a
   hearing room testifying.”

   That Werner and SunPower appear to have come out the other side of the
   tariff storm in decent shape — the stock is down less than 10% over the
   past two years and the company is positioned to capitalize on the
   growing U.S. rooftop-solar market — doesn’t negate the distractions
   that it caused. But it does suggest the approach of lobbying Washington
   relentlessly and adjusting plans quickly offers something of a loose
   guide to other executives ensnared in the trade war.

   “We simply could not afford the tariffs,” Werner says. “It was almost
   life or death. It was the biggest of big deals.”

   As a cocktail of renewables subsidies and mandates propelled American
   solar into the mainstream, developers came to rely on cheap imported
   equipment — much of it from Asian nations. The tariff threat upended
   the U.S. market, with the number of industry jobs sliding by almost
   8,000 last year. For SunPower, the duties proved costly: $1.5 million
   to $2 million in duties each week.

   When the announcement about levies was made in early 2018, it couldn’t
   have come at a worse time for the company. SunPower was in the midst of
   a restructuring, and its stock was down over 75% from the highs of
   2014. For Werner, getting a waiver was a priority.

   He made the case that SunPower was never subsidized by China, the
   country at the fore of Trump’s trade war, and doesn’t import panels
   from there. And he noted that the company produces premium panels,
   which are more expensive than what’s made in the Asian nation. But it
   was also true that the firm did most of its own manufacturing in
   Malaysia, Mexico and the Philippines.

   Government trade advisers were clear: they wanted U.S. solar
   manufacturing. Werner arranged to buy a factory in Hillsboro, Oregon,
   from a struggling peer after coming to favor what it offered: a ready
   workforce and a plant that could be brought online swiftly.

   The gambit worked. Within months, SunPower won a tariff exemption. By
   then, it had paid $46 million in tariffs imposed by the Trump
   administration, more than a quarter of its annual payroll last year.

   But that wasn’t the end of its trade story. Earlier this year, it faced
   potential duties on goods from Mexico, where it has a facility. That
   prospect forced Werner — who had been focused on a fundraising process
   that ultimately led to a spinoff of most of its manufacturing business
   — to swiftly consider alternatives.

   Trump didn’t follow through with the Mexico threat, but his
   administration soon introduced a surprise exemption for bifacial, or
   double-sided, panels — a decision that undermined SunPower’s own
   exclusion. While the government moved to close that loophole in
   October, an ongoing legal fight over its removal has at least
   temporarily kept it in place.

   “There’s a lot of uncertainty about United States trade policy,” says
   Michael Weinstein, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG. “Any kind of
   trade-war uncertainty drives up the cost of capital and makes the
   future more uncertain.”

   In some ways, the solar tariffs have succeeded. A few new factories
   have opened in the U.S. since they were imposed. SunPower — in which
   Total SA has a 49% stake — has invested in the Oregon factory, and now
   leases a third of the facility. It employs about 250 people there.

   “The Trump solar tariffs have been very effective at inducing hundreds
   of millions of dollars of new solar investment on U.S. soil and
   creating thousands of jobs,” White House trade adviser Peter Navarro
   wrote in an email.

   Before the tariffs were announced, Werner lobbied against their
   enactment. This wasn’t against type: he is one of the longest-tenured
   solar CEOs and reared on years of Silicon Valley’s free-market
   orthodoxy.

   Werner now says the experience has taught him the importance of not
   being overly reliant on any one part of the supply chain. Tariffs “do
   have an impact. They can change economics,” he says. “Supply chains are
   becoming more flexible. There are different priorities that exist now:
   flexibility, diversification, and future-proofing.”
