   already suffering from the Great Depression. Other countries retaliated

   has initiated three: a global tariff on steel, a tariff on European
   autos, and tariffs on Chinese imports. After Trump’s announcement,
   global stock markets tumbled in fear of a trade war between the world's
   three largest economies. In late 2018, several U.S. companies formed
   "Tariffs Hurt the Heartland.”﻿﻿ They are hurt by the rising costs of

   its reliance on Russian LNG and help out American farmers who have lost
   the Chinese market due to the trade war. But Russia's LNG price is much

   and aluminum. Soda and beer suppliers were the first to raise prices.﻿﻿

   go out of business.

   In the long term, trade wars slow economic growth. They create more
